02:10.150 --> 02:12.480
I had heard of demons...

02:12.690 --> 02:14.650
For the first time I saw one!

02:16.270 --> 02:19.400
No one should write or read about him!

02:21.860 --> 02:23.320
There should be no trace of him

02:23.320 --> 02:25.520
in the annals of history!

02:27.320 --> 02:28.820
I am enforcing the Army

02:30.320 --> 02:31.940
and signing a Death Warrant

02:32.440 --> 02:34.360
of the biggest criminal in India!

02:44.650 --> 02:46.440
This is ridiculous...

02:46.570 --> 02:48.900
How can somebody write something so careless...??

02:49.320 --> 02:50.860
That too a Senior Journalist,

02:50.860 --> 02:51.900
if he writes like this,

02:51.900 --> 02:53.070
I am unable to believe it!

02:53.270 --> 02:55.190
They wanted to publish this book too!

02:55.610 --> 02:56.730
But the Government...

02:56.730 --> 02:58.900
has banned this book then after seizing it,

02:59.150 --> 03:00.520
they burnt all the copies...

03:00.770 --> 03:02.360
From the Police Source

03:02.360 --> 03:04.360
Now I have received
this one copy!

03:06.650 --> 03:07.320
Deepa...

03:07.820 --> 03:08.770
Call him for an interview...

03:08.860 --> 03:10.730
Sir, I know that he is a Senior Journalist!

03:11.520 --> 03:12.690
But, in this book...

03:12.690 --> 03:14.570
I am unable to see a single truth!

03:15.110 --> 03:16.820
I have an interview to take in Delhi...

03:16.820 --> 03:18.230
And I am getting late for the flight!

03:18.570 --> 03:21.020
If the Government itself, in banning and seizing this book

03:21.070 --> 03:22.520
has shown interest means

03:22.520 --> 03:23.940
there must be some truth in it, is it not?

03:26.980 --> 03:29.320
I may be the owner of this TV Channel,

03:29.320 --> 03:30.770
But you are the face of it...

03:30.940 --> 03:32.480
And you have to take your own decision!

03:32.820 --> 03:34.770
But since 50 years

03:35.070 --> 03:36.440
I have been observing Anand...

03:36.820 --> 03:38.610
To even write a single word,

03:38.730 --> 03:40.400
he thinks a hundred times...

03:40.650 --> 03:41.860
He has written a whole book!

03:45.400 --> 03:46.650
I will give you half an hour's time!

03:48.270 --> 03:50.610
After that, you can find someone else to do the job!

03:56.230 --> 03:57.020
Shyam...
- Sir...

03:57.020 --> 03:58.940
Arrange the Interview in the Archives room!

03:58.980 --> 04:00.150
Send everybody outside...
- Hello everybody

04:00.150 --> 04:01.650
Nobody should know about this...
- Please clear the room!

04:01.650 --> 04:02.070
Leave... Leave...

04:02.150 --> 04:03.360
I don't want a live recording...

04:03.570 --> 04:04.110
All right sir!

04:18.399 --> 04:19.860
We are journalists,

04:20.820 --> 04:22.520
the smallest of things...

04:22.520 --> 04:24.110
We hook, find and pull out!

04:26.400 --> 04:27.940
In this book that you have written,

04:27.940 --> 04:29.150
such a big thing...

04:31.110 --> 04:33.690
It will give rise to a deluge of questions...

04:35.070 --> 04:39.110
These things directly implicate big people...

04:42.650 --> 04:44.940
Thinking, I will become a big officer,
I came to Bangalore...

04:44.980 --> 04:47.230
Thought of staying here, doing some odd jobs...

04:47.230 --> 04:49.150
these scoundrels trouble me in office...

04:49.230 --> 04:51.440
On one hand, without money I cannot go to back to my village...

04:51.480 --> 04:52.820
can't repay the loan, my father has taken!

04:52.820 --> 04:54.020
Come to eat sir, come to eat!

04:54.110 --> 04:54.860
Hey! Get lost!

04:55.150 --> 04:55.980
Goddess Yellamma of Soudathi!

04:56.270 --> 04:58.610
Give this poor man a little courage and protect him!

04:58.690 --> 04:59.610
Madam, for rape,

04:59.690 --> 05:01.070
only men are to blame...

05:01.070 --> 05:02.070
Shut up Mr. Nagaraj...

05:02.070 --> 05:03.690
I have had enough nonsense for today!

05:03.690 --> 05:05.690
Oh God! What's this! This woman is behaving like Goddess Durga!
- We are going to take a short break!

05:05.690 --> 05:07.690
To Deepa madam, in the Archives room,

05:07.690 --> 05:08.520
who will serve tea man?

05:14.610 --> 05:16.820
It's based on a true story... You have written!

05:16.940 --> 05:18.610
For this imagination of yours, what records do have?

05:19.230 --> 05:20.690
Will people read all this?

05:20.690 --> 05:22.070
Will they believe all this?

05:23.940 --> 05:24.980
Give me that book!

05:42.440 --> 05:43.360
Now, will they read it?

05:44.400 --> 05:45.980
Do you know what El Dorado means?

05:46.650 --> 05:48.190
You Mean - The Lost City of Gold?

05:48.980 --> 05:50.650
Since thousands of years,

05:50.730 --> 05:53.610
knowing that there is a Golden Kingdom, many kings...

05:53.610 --> 05:55.020
In a mad bid to seek that,

05:55.020 --> 05:56.900
have lost many armies!

05:56.900 --> 05:58.440
Not a single soul was able to salvage it!

05:58.820 --> 06:00.020
If anyone had got it,

06:00.020 --> 06:02.020
he would have become the greatest king of them all!

06:02.400 --> 06:02.900
Isn't that so?

06:03.980 --> 06:04.400
Possibly...

06:04.900 --> 06:06.820
I have written this book about someone like that!

06:08.480 --> 06:08.900
But...

06:08.900 --> 06:09.900
This is not an imagination,

06:10.020 --> 06:11.360
to show that it is real,

06:11.610 --> 06:13.400
in this world there is only one record!

06:15.020 --> 06:16.270
What is buried in the sands...

06:16.860 --> 06:17.690
The Symbolic Heroic Stone!

06:19.070 --> 06:19.730
Symbolic Heroic Stone??

06:20.400 --> 06:22.610
To wash clothes, the stone that is next to the pond,

06:22.610 --> 06:23.320
Not that stone!

06:24.150 --> 06:25.110
In the stone,

06:25.110 --> 06:26.820
if his picture has been etched,

06:27.650 --> 06:29.320
then he must have achieved something big!

06:34.110 --> 06:35.070
That Symbolic Heroic Stone of yours

06:35.070 --> 06:36.110
however deep it may be buried,

06:36.900 --> 06:38.320
I want to see it!

06:39.270 --> 06:40.400
I want to see it...

06:41.230 --> 06:42.110
The stone...

06:42.320 --> 06:43.270
If it exists!

06:43.650 --> 06:45.110
Get an excavation team ready!

06:45.110 --> 06:45.980
Let it cost any amount!

06:46.230 --> 06:46.980
Let's dig it out...

06:47.980 --> 06:48.980
Where shall we send them sir?

06:49.730 --> 06:50.820
Where is your Symbolic Heroic Stone??

06:54.400 --> 06:55.070
Where is it?

06:55.320 --> 06:55.980
Your...

06:56.610 --> 06:57.900
El Dorado!

07:23.400 --> 07:25.270
18km away from KGF town you will get Baagnur...

07:25.270 --> 07:26.270
From there, on the Baindoor road,

07:26.270 --> 07:27.230
after 12 Km if you take left,

07:27.230 --> 07:28.520
after 4 Km you will get a hill on the left...

07:28.520 --> 07:30.650
Near that hill, there is a Desert Palm tree...

07:30.650 --> 07:32.690
surrounding the tree, within 35 feet if you did,

07:32.690 --> 07:33.730
you will find the Symbolic Heroic Stone...
Is what he has said sir!

07:34.400 --> 07:35.770
Arrange a team,

07:35.770 --> 07:36.730
leave today itself

07:36.730 --> 07:37.770
dig that and take it out...

07:37.770 --> 07:38.610
Sir, are you serious?

07:39.070 --> 07:40.360
In 3 days, it's my wedding sir!

07:40.610 --> 07:42.190
Just because the old man inside told, can we set off?

07:42.520 --> 07:44.270
The man inside is Anand Ingaligi...

07:44.860 --> 07:46.320
So I am damn serious!

07:47.150 --> 07:47.520
Sir...

07:49.320 --> 07:51.650
From 1950 to 1980,

07:51.650 --> 07:52.860
All the papers are here...

07:53.360 --> 07:55.190
A good many more papers, I have asked for,

07:55.520 --> 07:57.440
but in all these papers, about KGF,

07:57.440 --> 07:58.650
there is not a single article!

07:59.610 --> 08:00.690
That's fine, leave these papers...

08:02.070 --> 08:02.820
Leave this book!

08:04.440 --> 08:05.520
Let's hear it from you!

08:06.190 --> 08:07.360
From your mouth, let's hear it...

08:07.730 --> 08:08.520
Who is that person?

08:08.860 --> 08:10.400
Was he a hero...

08:10.400 --> 08:11.270
Or was he a villain??

08:13.900 --> 08:15.110
What happened in that place?

08:19.820 --> 08:22.820
The gold found in KGF has enormous value!

08:23.860 --> 08:26.110
But behind the hands that took it out,

08:26.520 --> 08:27.730
There lies a huge history!

08:33.230 --> 08:35.400
In the world, wherever gold is found,

08:35.690 --> 08:36.820
it's found by chance!

08:40.480 --> 08:42.270
In 1951

08:42.270 --> 08:45.270
at a distance of 18 Km from KGF,

08:45.520 --> 08:46.980
while farmers were digging a well,

08:46.980 --> 08:48.650
they found a strange stone...

08:49.270 --> 08:52.110
To investigate that, government officers came,

08:52.480 --> 08:54.230
with them Suryavardhan was present!

08:57.440 --> 08:58.270
Mother!

09:31.650 --> 09:33.020
It was destiny's act...

09:33.230 --> 09:34.070
That night

09:34.320 --> 09:36.020
two incidents occurred!

09:36.690 --> 09:38.150
That place was discovered...

09:39.980 --> 09:40.940
And he too was born!

09:45.110 --> 09:47.230
Like how stones and boulders are found,

09:47.230 --> 09:48.480
it's not that easy to find gold!

09:49.900 --> 09:51.440
But Suryavardhan...

09:51.440 --> 09:54.110
found all boulders to be infested with gold!

09:54.820 --> 09:58.230
He did not let even an atom of dust to fly away from there...

09:59.070 --> 10:02.190
You have given birth to a son like an emperor...

10:02.440 --> 10:03.150
My dear...

10:21.150 --> 10:22.770
He doesn't have a father man...

10:22.770 --> 10:24.650
The mother is suffering a lot!

10:24.650 --> 10:25.860
Do you want a father??

10:44.770 --> 10:46.270
Suryavardhan took that land

10:46.270 --> 10:48.110
for Limestone Mining

10:48.110 --> 10:50.320
for 99 years on lease!

10:54.730 --> 10:56.940
To safeguard the secret...

10:56.940 --> 10:59.610
He brought people by force

10:59.610 --> 11:00.900
And started Mining.

11:07.820 --> 11:08.860
Child...

11:08.860 --> 11:10.440
To save your mother's life...

11:10.440 --> 11:12.110
This much money is not sufficient my dear!

11:18.730 --> 11:20.230
Marriage at 14...

11:20.650 --> 11:22.270
A baby at 15...

11:22.570 --> 11:23.980
A life full of sorrows...

11:24.270 --> 11:25.360
At 25 years,

11:25.360 --> 11:27.150
death had came searching for her!

11:27.520 --> 11:29.570
But, to leave behind for her son...

11:29.570 --> 11:31.320
She had only one asset!

11:32.110 --> 11:33.270
Her last words...

11:34.860 --> 11:36.730
Everyone thinks that if they money,

11:36.730 --> 11:39.480
They can live a very peaceful life...

11:41.860 --> 11:42.770
But,

11:42.770 --> 11:46.360
without money, one can't even die peacefully...

11:47.650 --> 11:49.440
This no one thinks about!

11:54.190 --> 11:55.650
Give me your word...

11:58.900 --> 12:01.190
I don't know how you will survive,

12:02.190 --> 12:03.440
but when you die...

12:04.070 --> 12:05.770
You must be dominant

12:07.770 --> 12:10.150
As a immensely wealthy man...
You should die!

12:15.770 --> 12:17.940
I will become a very wealthy man, mama...

12:32.820 --> 12:34.440
She only showed him the goal,

12:35.150 --> 12:36.820
But the path to reach it,

12:36.820 --> 12:38.480
he had to choose it himself!

12:41.480 --> 12:42.770
Give me money! Money! Money!

12:43.150 --> 12:44.190
I don't have...

12:45.270 --> 12:46.110
You don't have money?

12:48.230 --> 12:49.020
Here take money...

12:50.400 --> 12:51.440
Hey...

12:51.570 --> 12:52.690
This is not enough for me...

12:52.690 --> 12:53.730
I need more!

12:54.020 --> 12:55.150
Not enough?

12:56.320 --> 12:58.270
For trifles, you must beg...

12:58.440 --> 13:00.480
For more, you have to thrash!

13:07.900 --> 13:08.770
Power...

13:09.610 --> 13:11.190
It's only if you have power,
will you have money...

13:11.980 --> 13:12.770
Power...

13:13.270 --> 13:14.150
Where will I find it??

13:19.820 --> 13:21.400
For that dream,

13:21.610 --> 13:23.520
he reached the city of friction, Bombay!

13:24.610 --> 13:25.230
Scoundrel, get up...

13:25.230 --> 13:26.110
This is my place!

13:28.230 --> 13:30.320
Bombay, for the gold black market...

13:30.360 --> 13:31.440
was the main place!

13:31.820 --> 13:33.190
For this region,

13:33.400 --> 13:35.400
two 2 gold smugglers...

13:35.480 --> 13:37.270
Dubai's Inayat Khaleel

13:38.110 --> 13:39.900
and Bombay's Shetty...

13:39.900 --> 13:41.980
Between them endless war was on!

13:43.110 --> 13:45.400
In this war another person entered!

13:46.150 --> 13:48.270
Even though his slipper size was small,

13:48.440 --> 13:50.770
That path where he laid his footsteps was big!

13:51.570 --> 13:52.230
Go...

13:52.730 --> 13:53.400
Tell me your name!

13:53.520 --> 13:55.020
Raja Krishna Beria.

13:56.570 --> 13:59.440
In Bombay, if you do big tasks,
you will earn a big name!

13:59.440 --> 14:01.190
then even small names will be remembered...

14:03.110 --> 14:03.690
Go!

14:03.730 --> 14:09.190
Polish... Polish...

14:09.360 --> 14:10.190
Shetty...

14:10.730 --> 14:12.480
Everyone salutes him!

14:12.980 --> 14:14.820
He is the king of Bombay!

14:16.440 --> 14:17.230
That bloody Shinde,

14:17.230 --> 14:18.480
is troubling Shetty brother a lot!

14:18.480 --> 14:19.570
We have to crack his head!

14:19.980 --> 14:20.940
Are you crazy?

14:21.150 --> 14:22.770
Who will dare hit an Inspector?

14:22.980 --> 14:23.690
Will you hit him?

14:23.820 --> 14:25.150
Will anyone in Bombay hit him?

14:25.270 --> 14:27.020
Or will these kids hit him?

14:27.270 --> 14:29.110
Will any of you hit the inspector, kids?

14:29.360 --> 14:30.190
Is anybody like that here?

14:43.820 --> 14:46.190
I found a man! Bugger!

14:46.730 --> 14:48.360
Hey! Aslam Boss said it in jest

14:48.360 --> 14:50.110
and you have seriously come to hit him!

14:50.110 --> 14:51.480
Hey! Come man!

14:52.440 --> 14:55.610
Let anyone call me a savage...

14:56.650 --> 14:59.070
Let them repeatedly call me thus...
- Hey... Child!

15:14.860 --> 15:15.650
What happened?

15:15.860 --> 15:16.650
Let's go... Come man!

15:17.110 --> 15:17.730
He...

15:17.940 --> 15:19.270
He doesn't know my name!

15:19.270 --> 15:19.820
What??

15:22.820 --> 15:23.480
He...

15:24.190 --> 15:25.650
He doesn't know who I am!

15:28.150 --> 15:28.940
Who is that boy?

15:28.940 --> 15:29.820
I want him!

15:39.230 --> 15:40.520
Not a boy...

15:40.520 --> 15:42.480
My name is Rocky,

15:44.190 --> 15:45.980
you will remember it, right?

15:47.610 --> 15:48.900
Rocky!

15:52.440 --> 15:54.020
Sir, he is my boy sir...

15:54.480 --> 15:55.820
I had made him sit in Andheri!

15:56.020 --> 15:57.770
In jest I asked him to hit the police...
But he!

15:57.770 --> 15:58.980
Don't worry about it man...

15:59.230 --> 16:01.150
From the police, I have set him free!

16:05.900 --> 16:06.320
Hey!

16:06.440 --> 16:07.400
Where had you gone man?

16:09.940 --> 16:11.770
Had gone to earn my name!

16:12.770 --> 16:14.190
Why did you hit the policemen?

16:15.480 --> 16:17.110
If you hit someone,

16:17.690 --> 16:18.730
the police will search for you!

16:19.980 --> 16:21.940
If you hit the police itself,

16:24.230 --> 16:26.190
A Don like you will search!

16:27.690 --> 16:28.440
Hey...

16:31.070 --> 16:32.770
What do you want??

16:35.270 --> 16:36.270
The world...

16:47.900 --> 16:50.190
In 1978,

16:50.190 --> 16:53.360
due to the crisis between Iran and Afghanistan,

16:53.360 --> 16:54.650
The enmity between United States

16:54.650 --> 16:57.570
and Soviet Union had amplified!

16:58.360 --> 17:00.940
The outcome impacted the whole world!

17:01.860 --> 17:04.730
Along with oil, coffee, steel and cotton prices...

17:04.730 --> 17:06.650
Gold prices touched the skies!

17:07.270 --> 17:09.270
By then, Suryavadhan

17:09.270 --> 17:11.859
had reached a stature that one one could touch!

17:11.859 --> 17:14.400
To firmly establish this empire,

17:14.400 --> 17:17.569
he had selected 5 partners as his 5 pillars!

17:17.819 --> 17:19.980
After Barghav departed, his son Kamal

17:19.980 --> 17:22.069
was taking the raw material that came from KGF,

17:22.069 --> 17:24.150
from that in the factory he was extracting gold!

17:24.819 --> 17:26.190
The gold that was extracted there

17:26.190 --> 17:29.650
would be brought to Bangalore
and the responsibility of distributing it everywhere

17:30.320 --> 17:31.480
was overseen by Rajendra Desai.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.440
Andrews...

17:33.520 --> 17:35.610
The western region was in his control!

17:36.400 --> 17:37.400
Gurupandyan...

17:37.400 --> 17:39.270
The political strength that he had

17:39.270 --> 17:40.940
was supported by Suryavardhan

17:40.940 --> 17:42.820
and entering national politics

17:43.270 --> 17:45.360
He kept the government in his hands!

17:46.020 --> 17:48.360
Suryavardhan's biggest strength was

17:48.360 --> 17:50.110
his brother Adheera!

17:50.440 --> 17:53.110
With his shrewdness, for this fort that was built

17:53.110 --> 17:55.820
Suryavardhan's son Garuda too became a part!

17:55.820 --> 17:57.650
Because of both of them, now KGF

17:57.650 --> 18:00.860
was so well protected that no one could point a finger at it!

18:01.400 --> 18:04.150
But one day he got a stroke and fell bedridden...

18:04.770 --> 18:08.980
Everyone working under Suryavardhan,
who was in the jaws of death,

18:08.980 --> 18:10.570
started desiring KGF!

18:10.690 --> 18:12.480
For the first time in KGF,

18:12.480 --> 18:14.270
shouts of mutiny were heard!

18:17.070 --> 18:18.610
Due to the rise in gold prices,

18:18.610 --> 18:20.980
greed had increased in Inayat Khaleel

18:20.980 --> 18:24.070
He thought it to be the right time to enter Bombay!

18:25.150 --> 18:27.270
With Shetty's competitor, Dilawar

18:27.270 --> 18:29.020
Inayath Khaleel joined hands with him

18:29.770 --> 18:31.400
and to Bombay's Nagpade port,

18:31.400 --> 18:32.820
He sent his gold.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.440
But before that came,

18:35.440 --> 18:38.020
Dilawar tried to take control of Bombay!

18:39.110 --> 18:40.270
It is Dilwar's order...

18:40.270 --> 18:41.820
We have to wipe off Shetty gang totally...

18:44.360 --> 18:45.690
We must not leave anyone!

18:47.270 --> 18:49.230
Did you put our boys in the prison?

18:49.230 --> 18:51.480
Whose boys they are? Do you know that?

18:52.190 --> 18:54.020
1st time after Independence

18:54.020 --> 18:55.730
Bombay was on high alert

18:56.400 --> 18:59.270
Dilwar was just about to take control of Bombay,

18:59.270 --> 19:01.360
But he had a huge problem...

19:04.150 --> 19:05.230
Don... But Rocky?

19:05.230 --> 19:06.360
Stop Salim brother!

19:06.360 --> 19:07.150
We have not found him yet,

19:07.150 --> 19:08.480
Once we find him, we will let you know...

19:08.480 --> 19:09.150
You wait for now!

19:09.860 --> 19:10.520
Did you find him??

19:10.520 --> 19:11.650
We have not yet found him...

19:12.070 --> 19:13.400
Tell me... Tell me where is Rocky!

19:13.520 --> 19:15.230
But we have put all the rest in prison!

19:15.230 --> 19:16.230
What's the use...??

19:16.230 --> 19:17.480
First, catch him! Go...

19:17.480 --> 19:18.820
Search for him man!

19:18.820 --> 19:20.070
Search everywhere...

19:22.160 --> 19:22.570
What??

19:26.910 --> 19:28.070
They have caught Rocky Boss...

19:29.530 --> 19:30.700
We found him, come!

19:36.530 --> 19:41.370
Kill him!

19:56.200 --> 19:57.950
My father told me about him!

19:57.950 --> 19:58.660
My son...

19:58.870 --> 20:00.780
Don't challenge the typhoon!

20:02.030 --> 20:03.370
Hey! Go man!

20:03.820 --> 20:05.070
Tell my father!

20:05.320 --> 20:06.410
Your son...

20:06.410 --> 20:08.160
Has hung the typhoon itself!

20:08.410 --> 20:09.160
What is it Aslam?

20:09.160 --> 20:10.660
Your faces are so glum?

20:10.660 --> 20:11.700
Is anyone dead or what?

20:11.780 --> 20:12.570
Hey kiddo,

20:13.070 --> 20:13.950
go and get a Biryani Rice...

20:14.200 --> 20:15.370
Why are you looking at me like that?

20:15.700 --> 20:16.740
Go my boy!

20:16.870 --> 20:18.490
They have caught Rocky!

20:21.370 --> 20:22.070
They have found Rocky...

20:22.070 --> 20:22.700
Get the stuff and come!

20:23.160 --> 20:24.370
Hey...

20:24.370 --> 20:25.280
Come on...

20:25.450 --> 20:28.570
Inayath Khaleel's boats will reach our port...

20:29.280 --> 20:31.240
Bombay will be lost to us!

20:40.530 --> 20:42.530
Today's my birthday...

20:42.740 --> 20:44.780
As a present,

20:44.910 --> 20:46.200
his heart...

20:46.780 --> 20:48.660
And his eyes, I want both!

20:49.070 --> 20:50.910
What all do all of you want, tell me!

20:50.910 --> 20:53.820
Kill him!

20:53.820 --> 20:54.700
Kiddo...

20:56.030 --> 20:56.820
Cancel the Kushka,

20:57.410 --> 20:58.160
bring a proper Biriyani,

20:58.530 --> 21:00.370
With that get more onions...

21:00.660 --> 21:01.200
Now go...

21:02.820 --> 21:03.620
Kill him! Kill him!

21:03.740 --> 21:05.740
The smell of blood has made

21:05.740 --> 21:08.200
all the Piranha fish to come together!

21:08.450 --> 21:10.570
Since the past 15 years,
the work that you were not able to do,

21:10.570 --> 21:12.200
your son has accomplished it in a single day!

21:12.450 --> 21:14.320
But those fish did not know,

21:14.700 --> 21:15.620
that blood

21:15.620 --> 21:18.160
was that of the shark that would hunt them!

21:18.780 --> 21:23.280
Happy Birthday To You...
- Kill him!

21:24.700 --> 21:28.740
Happy Birthday To You...

21:29.070 --> 21:29.990
Where is he??

21:30.200 --> 21:31.160
They have hung him...

21:31.780 --> 21:35.700
Happy Birthday To You...
- Not him... Where is my son??

21:35.950 --> 21:36.660
Your son...

21:36.990 --> 21:38.200
He is in front of him!

21:38.450 --> 21:42.450
Happy Birthday To You...

21:43.030 --> 21:45.320
Happy Birthday...

21:45.320 --> 21:47.910
Hey! You don't hang the typhoon!

21:48.160 --> 21:49.160
What are you watching??

21:49.160 --> 21:49.990
Kill him!

21:52.660 --> 21:56.910
Happy Birthday To You...
- We run from the typhoon!

22:02.030 --> 22:05.820
'Bombay is mine' those who used to roam the roads saying so...

22:05.820 --> 22:07.490
He has brought them all together!

22:08.370 --> 22:10.700
All of them, in the very same roads...

22:11.870 --> 22:13.700
He will chase and kill them!

22:14.120 --> 22:17.370
My blood also seems to be red guys!

22:34.620 --> 22:37.700
When I was a kid itself, I came to Bombay!

22:38.570 --> 22:40.200
It was like falling into a furnace!

22:40.910 --> 22:42.530
On these very roads...

22:42.740 --> 22:44.820
When I asked for two meals a day,
they hit me up...

22:44.820 --> 22:47.530
To sleep, when I asked for three feet of space...
They beat me!

22:48.620 --> 22:51.070
But Bombay did not know then...

22:51.410 --> 22:54.160
What was fallen in the furnace, was iron!

22:54.490 --> 22:56.370
Banging it several times

22:56.370 --> 22:57.740
and hitting it over and again

22:57.740 --> 22:59.910
it has now become a knife!

23:00.160 --> 23:02.030
A knife knows only one thing...

23:02.530 --> 23:04.120
Does Bombay belong to your father??

23:05.030 --> 23:06.280
No man...

23:06.280 --> 23:07.410
It's your father's!

23:07.700 --> 23:09.030
And your father...

23:10.280 --> 23:10.950
I am he!

23:11.030 --> 23:12.620
Kill...
Kill him!

23:50.490 --> 23:51.320
Kill him!

24:01.780 --> 24:02.530
Why man?

24:04.660 --> 24:06.950
You are scared seeing how I hit them?

24:06.950 --> 24:09.700
To them, I just said cheers and sipped!

24:09.700 --> 24:12.070
For you, I will have Bottoms-Up...

24:12.070 --> 24:13.530
and lick the pickle!

24:14.320 --> 24:14.870
Run!

24:16.660 --> 24:17.660
Come on, come on man!

24:18.370 --> 24:19.030
Come! Come!

24:31.490 --> 24:32.240
Come on...

24:32.240 --> 24:33.070
Stop him man!

24:45.990 --> 24:47.740
He is coming... Stop him man!

25:02.450 --> 25:03.120
He is coming...

25:04.620 --> 25:05.280
He is coming!

25:41.950 --> 25:42.700
He is coming...

26:00.240 --> 26:01.030
Brother!

26:01.700 --> 26:02.490
Brother!

26:06.910 --> 26:07.620
Hey...

26:07.870 --> 26:09.030
Where is the butcher's knife?

26:16.370 --> 26:19.240
If Bombay faces the ocean on one side!
- Hey... Stop! Stop! Stop!

26:19.410 --> 26:20.870
On the other side is Rocky!

26:23.200 --> 26:25.370
Even the waves, to come and touch the shore here...

26:25.410 --> 26:26.530
Go back... Go back...

26:26.530 --> 26:29.120
Go! Go! Go! Go back!
- They have to seek his permission!

26:38.280 --> 26:39.490
Turn it! Turn it! Turn it!

26:43.030 --> 26:44.740
Go! Go! Go!

26:54.120 --> 26:54.820
Tell me...

26:54.820 --> 26:57.280
The right guy to dig a pit for the elephant...
In Bombay we have found!

26:58.820 --> 26:59.410
Rocky!

27:08.780 --> 27:10.570
Inayath Khaleel's ship is going back Boss...

27:11.410 --> 27:12.200
What Boss?

27:14.990 --> 27:15.990
Was Bombay saved??

27:23.870 --> 27:25.320
An order to stop!

27:27.700 --> 27:29.320
Ruling over life!

27:31.780 --> 27:33.570
Ruling over death!

27:43.530 --> 27:46.450
He is the life of Mumbai...

27:46.450 --> 27:47.370
The very life man!

27:47.370 --> 27:49.280
Don't dare stare at his eyes!

27:49.280 --> 27:51.240
Lightning will strike...
Run away!

27:51.280 --> 27:53.240
Fire and storm,
Whenever they unite!

27:53.240 --> 27:55.070
A dynamite like him is born!

27:55.160 --> 27:56.870
Oh! God!

27:56.870 --> 27:58.120
Look here!

27:58.740 --> 28:00.740
If he comes to rule,
He is the emperor!

28:00.740 --> 28:02.950
If you oppose him...
He is the very devil!

28:02.950 --> 28:04.570
Oh God!

28:04.570 --> 28:05.780
Please stop him!

28:06.870 --> 28:08.820
The hidden one is acquired!

28:08.820 --> 28:10.490
The one who revolts is captured!

28:10.490 --> 28:12.450
In the streets of Mumbai,

28:12.490 --> 28:14.530
With fright they will say 'Salute'!

28:16.160 --> 28:18.160
Salute Rocky Don!

28:18.160 --> 28:19.820
Ra... Ra... Rocky!

28:20.070 --> 28:22.070
Salute Rocky Don!

28:23.660 --> 28:25.530
Salute Rocky Don!

28:25.660 --> 28:27.660
Salute Rocky Don!

28:27.740 --> 28:29.740
This locality is yours Don!!

28:30.030 --> 28:32.030
You are everyone's boss!

28:32.740 --> 28:34.160
From Africa, the gold that was coming directly

28:34.870 --> 28:36.070
through the coast guards

28:36.070 --> 28:37.740
was getting unloaded at the Bombay port!

28:37.910 --> 28:39.530
From there under police security,

28:39.700 --> 28:41.030
in grey coloured marked truck,

28:41.450 --> 28:43.120
Rocky used to get the material...

28:43.530 --> 28:46.160
The sealed boxes, in his absence,
were never opened!

28:46.490 --> 28:48.620
He used to check it and to all other places...

28:48.740 --> 28:51.530
he himself distributed it, through the Goods Train!

28:53.410 --> 28:54.820
Without Rocky's orders,

28:54.820 --> 28:57.200
in Bombay, no decisions were being taken!

29:16.320 --> 29:18.280
The one who held your finger and made you walk...

29:18.280 --> 29:20.240
The one who taught you your first words...

29:20.240 --> 29:23.240
Her words are sacred!

29:31.870 --> 29:33.780
One who has grown with fire!

29:33.780 --> 29:35.780
Persistently moving ahead!

29:35.780 --> 29:38.820
A warrior who has taken an oath!

29:49.240 --> 29:53.070
Where can you find an army to stop him?

29:53.120 --> 29:56.870
Is it possible to control a surging wave?

29:56.870 --> 29:58.780
He is filled with character!
His hand is like iron!

29:58.780 --> 30:00.870
He sells fear,
cares nothing for life!

30:00.870 --> 30:02.530
Move away...

30:02.530 --> 30:03.780
There's danger!

30:04.950 --> 30:06.570
The hidden one is acquired!
- It can't be done!

30:06.910 --> 30:08.570
The one who revolts is captured!

30:08.820 --> 30:10.740
In the streets of Mumbai,

30:10.740 --> 30:12.490
With fright they will say 'Salute'!

30:13.910 --> 30:14.530
What is it man??

30:14.530 --> 30:15.910
The clothes for wash, we had come to give brother...

30:16.200 --> 30:17.570
I too came for washing only!

30:17.570 --> 30:18.200
Pour it!

30:19.950 --> 30:21.950
Salute Rocky Don!

30:21.950 --> 30:23.620
Ra... Ra... Rocky!

30:23.870 --> 30:25.870
Salute Rocky Don!

30:27.450 --> 30:29.320
Salute Rocky Don!

30:29.450 --> 30:31.450
Salute Rocky Don!

30:31.530 --> 30:33.530
This locality is yours Don!!

30:33.820 --> 30:35.820
You are everyone's boss!

30:36.620 --> 30:39.490
Henceforth Inayath Khaleel's men won't ever bother us...

30:39.740 --> 30:41.200
Everything is fine... Let it be!

30:42.280 --> 30:43.280
Because of Rocky!

30:45.450 --> 30:46.950
That shooter of yours...

30:46.950 --> 30:48.530
Is accomplishing so much...

30:48.740 --> 30:51.070
Is it for Shetty
or is it for Bombay??

30:51.950 --> 30:53.660
We are all with you Shetty Don...

30:54.120 --> 30:55.910
But... It is beacuse Rocky is with us

30:55.910 --> 30:57.160
that we all are so bold!

30:58.320 --> 31:00.240
Rocky's name, not only in Bombay

31:00.240 --> 31:02.120
but in the entire South Coast...
It is being heard!

31:02.120 --> 31:03.870
Rocky brother,

31:14.450 --> 31:15.410
What Rocky brother??

31:15.410 --> 31:16.910
Today, how many people did you kill??

31:16.910 --> 31:17.570
After the day ends,

31:17.570 --> 31:19.530
I will count and tell you! You go!

31:24.030 --> 31:25.240
Greetings Don!
Greetings Don!

31:26.240 --> 31:26.530
Greetings Don!

31:26.660 --> 31:28.870
In Bombay, everybody salutes you...

31:32.490 --> 31:33.990
Other than Rocky...

31:34.620 --> 31:37.120
Rocky likes your chair a lot!

31:37.120 --> 31:39.370
If he feels he has the same right to it...

31:40.700 --> 31:41.660
Then it will become very difficult!

31:44.700 --> 31:46.530
It's only till the nest is built...

31:47.070 --> 31:48.410
That the silk worm's life span extends!

31:49.660 --> 31:50.740
After that...

31:51.620 --> 31:52.910
They are just put in hot water!

32:03.530 --> 32:04.530
Hey Pathan!

32:04.530 --> 32:05.200
Yes Boss!

32:05.200 --> 32:06.570
In this Bombay city...

32:06.780 --> 32:09.320
Even if our address does not have a pincode,

32:09.320 --> 32:10.490
we get the post!

32:10.660 --> 32:11.820
Do you know why??

32:11.820 --> 32:14.160
That's because our name is so famous!

32:14.160 --> 32:14.990
Yes Boss!

32:15.200 --> 32:17.570
Can everybody become like you Boss?

32:17.700 --> 32:19.410
Some people hit ten people

32:19.410 --> 32:21.070
and think that they have become a 'Don'!

33:05.160 --> 33:06.200
Rocky!

33:23.570 --> 33:26.070
In Bangalore, you have to finish a task for me...

33:27.030 --> 33:28.280
If you do that...

33:28.490 --> 33:29.780
The whole of Bombay...

33:30.030 --> 33:30.990
Will be yours!

33:55.120 --> 33:56.370
The post arrives,

33:56.370 --> 33:58.240
not by looking at the address on the letter!

34:02.370 --> 34:04.370
It is due to the landmark that is on the address!

34:05.740 --> 34:07.910
For this landmark, forget the pincode...

34:10.699 --> 34:12.280
You won't even need a stamp!

34:14.070 --> 34:15.409
A golden bank...

34:16.030 --> 34:17.820
They are using to cash trifling coins!

34:29.239 --> 34:30.280
Hey Pathan!

34:30.280 --> 34:30.780
Yes Boss!

34:33.489 --> 34:36.870
I am not someone who hit ten people and became a 'Don',

34:37.620 --> 34:40.989
All the ten people I hit were Dons!

34:42.739 --> 34:43.409
Yes Boss!

34:52.949 --> 34:54.409
Shetty saluting someone else...

34:54.409 --> 34:55.530
I saw it for the first time!

34:55.530 --> 34:57.910
Looks like he decides what happens in Bombay!

34:58.160 --> 34:59.320
That Shetty won't leave us,

34:59.320 --> 35:00.450
he will do something or the other to us...

35:00.450 --> 35:01.700
So what are we?
Are we wearing bangles or what??

35:01.700 --> 35:02.870
You shut up man!

35:03.410 --> 35:04.870
Don't you worry about Shetty!

35:05.120 --> 35:06.320
All the boys are with you...

35:06.700 --> 35:08.070
You used to ask always...

35:08.070 --> 35:09.120
'I want Bombay'!

35:09.200 --> 35:10.200
Now the time has come!

35:11.030 --> 35:12.070
Now you...

35:12.070 --> 35:13.620
You will be the King of Bombay!

35:17.070 --> 35:18.700
How deep is the ocean?

35:18.820 --> 35:19.280
What??

35:20.410 --> 35:22.700
Without knowing the depth,
you can't rule over it...

35:24.320 --> 35:26.120
Let's dive and find that out!

35:27.410 --> 35:29.530
To further my dreams of nearing El Dorado

35:29.530 --> 35:30.410
I got a twist...

35:31.780 --> 35:32.410
Bangalore!

35:42.160 --> 35:43.830
Stop the car near a bar!

35:44.170 --> 35:46.370
It's election time today sir...
The bar will not even be open!

35:51.130 --> 35:51.700
Why are you running like this...

35:51.790 --> 35:52.410
What happened??

35:52.540 --> 35:54.000
Rajendra Desai's daughter sir!

35:54.080 --> 35:55.250
In some hotel...
Just because they didn't serve drinks,

35:55.250 --> 35:57.540
she has blocked the road...
And is partying right here sir!

35:57.540 --> 35:59.580
Everyone who is looking at her is being hit!

35:59.580 --> 36:00.910
Don't go there sir... Come away sir...

36:00.910 --> 36:02.700
Help me... Help me!

36:02.700 --> 36:03.120
Sir...

36:03.950 --> 36:07.000
Sir help me!

36:07.370 --> 36:08.450
The one who is coming...

36:08.660 --> 36:09.500
Is he a sharp shooter?

36:09.910 --> 36:10.410
No...

36:10.870 --> 36:12.790
I don't even know how his marksmanship is!

36:14.910 --> 36:16.120
Then how did you trust him?

36:16.580 --> 36:17.700
When a hit is ordered

36:18.000 --> 36:19.660
A lot of procedures are followed...

36:19.950 --> 36:21.250
Sir, sir... Come sir!

36:21.250 --> 36:22.410
Don't try to save him sir!

36:22.700 --> 36:24.040
They are not good people... Come away sir!

36:24.620 --> 36:25.700
Eyes should not falter...

36:25.700 --> 36:26.870
The hand should not tremble...

36:27.040 --> 36:27.830
The breathe should be held...

36:27.830 --> 36:29.660
We should check the position we are standing in!

36:30.120 --> 36:31.370
In which direction the air flows...

36:31.370 --> 36:32.660
We should keep in mind!

36:34.660 --> 36:35.410
He...

36:35.580 --> 36:37.200
Will directly point on the forehead...

36:38.450 --> 36:39.410
And will pull the trigger...

36:40.290 --> 36:41.700
Sharp shooters are meant...

36:41.700 --> 36:42.790
Only for the Olympics!

36:43.450 --> 36:45.410
It's a lot of risk that we are working in...

36:45.910 --> 36:47.080
Even if we don't,

36:47.080 --> 36:48.290
it's a huge risk, is it not?

37:03.950 --> 37:07.540
Smoke... Have a smoke!

37:08.830 --> 37:12.410
Let your sorrows be gone!

37:14.160 --> 37:17.200
Say throughout the day...

37:17.200 --> 37:24.040
Praise be to Lord Krishna!
Praise be to Lord Ram!

37:24.040 --> 37:25.000
Congratulations!

37:25.080 --> 37:26.290
Smoke... Have a smoke!
- Why??

37:26.330 --> 37:28.080
Smoke... Have a smoke!
- I love you!

37:32.700 --> 37:33.950
How dare you!

37:33.950 --> 37:35.200
How fair are you!

37:35.540 --> 37:36.540
What are you looking at?

37:36.540 --> 37:37.250
Come hit him guys...

37:49.790 --> 37:50.950
Where was I...

37:59.080 --> 38:01.080
I am already dead, my dear!

38:13.120 --> 38:14.790
Hey guys!
Go!! Go hit him...

38:41.620 --> 38:42.910
What happened guys?
You won't attack me?

38:42.910 --> 38:43.910
Guys! Go!

39:03.000 --> 39:04.290
Hey guys! Go hit him!

39:09.080 --> 39:09.660
Now come on man...

39:18.040 --> 39:19.200
What are you looking at?? Go!!

39:44.410 --> 39:46.160
You damn rogue...

39:46.160 --> 39:48.120
You are wasting liquor!
You are wasting liquor!

39:54.160 --> 39:57.580
Do you know the value of liquor?!

39:58.000 --> 40:00.500
Only drunkards know the value of liquor!

40:12.000 --> 40:14.370
Looks like you have come
for the first time to Bangalore!

40:14.620 --> 40:16.500
You still don't know about me...

40:16.790 --> 40:18.750
After getting to know, don't run and hide!

40:19.080 --> 40:20.700
My father will find you wherever you are

40:20.700 --> 40:23.160
and drag you to this very road and hit you up!

40:23.370 --> 40:26.410
We don't have a habit of running away

40:26.410 --> 40:28.200
but we do have a habit of chasing!

40:28.790 --> 40:30.540
In my journey

40:30.540 --> 40:32.620
I have seen a good lot of smart guys...

40:33.080 --> 40:33.790
But...

40:34.830 --> 40:36.330
A lady who kills...

40:36.950 --> 40:38.250
I am seeing for first time!

40:39.250 --> 40:42.120
I have deeply falling in love with you...

40:42.790 --> 40:43.620
Shut up! Rocky!

40:43.660 --> 40:45.000
Shut up!

40:45.620 --> 40:46.620
Who did you say your father was?

40:47.040 --> 40:48.290
Rajendra Desai!

40:48.540 --> 40:51.450
He has taken care of you in a very rich way!

40:51.870 --> 40:53.750
I will take care of you in much better way!

40:53.870 --> 40:54.580
Don't worry!

40:54.660 --> 40:56.160
Leaving you, I will not go anywhere!

40:56.450 --> 40:58.250
I will come soon!

41:00.790 --> 41:02.450
Henceforth her father is my father-in-law

41:02.450 --> 41:03.950
and I am your brother-in-law!

41:03.950 --> 41:05.450
Your sister...

41:06.540 --> 41:08.000
Take good care of her!

41:08.830 --> 41:09.750
Do take good care of her!

41:20.250 --> 41:21.450
This is the address you told sir...

41:21.450 --> 41:22.700
Finish your work and go away sir!

41:22.700 --> 41:24.200
Once again don't come back to Bangalore sir!

41:42.870 --> 41:43.620
Kamal...

41:44.500 --> 41:45.450
What happened??

41:47.450 --> 41:49.200
Bangalore is very big... It seems!

41:50.700 --> 41:51.910
Searching for him is difficult... I believe!

41:55.950 --> 41:57.160
It must be someone new...

41:57.620 --> 41:59.200
Single-handedly he has hit up all our boys!

42:00.790 --> 42:01.500
Being drunk...

42:01.500 --> 42:02.750
With my Reena itself!

42:04.040 --> 42:06.750
Airport, railway station, bus-stand, highways...

42:06.750 --> 42:07.870
Everything should be shut down!

42:07.870 --> 42:08.790
That son of a gun!

42:08.790 --> 42:10.330
For no reason should be able to escape!

42:14.120 --> 42:16.040
He would have taunted Reena...

42:16.040 --> 42:17.000
I know this!

42:17.200 --> 42:19.290
Don't bring him here again Daya...

42:19.500 --> 42:21.370
Kamal! If your stars are not right...

42:22.040 --> 42:24.250
He will get caught by them somewhere!

42:36.450 --> 42:38.580
Do you know whose people you have hit and come?

42:38.750 --> 42:40.330
Do you know who that girl is??

42:40.870 --> 42:41.370
Who?

42:41.790 --> 42:43.200
Rajendra Desai's daughter

42:44.080 --> 42:44.620
Reena!

42:47.500 --> 42:49.250
I had returned without asking about her name!

42:49.620 --> 42:51.580
Reena...!

42:51.790 --> 42:53.620
What a sweet name!

42:53.620 --> 42:55.620
Why do you think we have called you here?!

42:56.120 --> 42:57.160
Right from when I came

42:57.160 --> 42:59.450
we are dilly-dallying outside the garden!

43:00.540 --> 43:02.450
Shall we come into the story?

43:04.250 --> 43:05.500
What is the task, tell me sir!

43:09.330 --> 43:10.950
You have to kill a mammoth!

43:14.750 --> 43:16.160
What is our plan

43:16.200 --> 43:17.750
that will be explained to you by Daya!

43:18.580 --> 43:19.910
In a few days...

43:19.910 --> 43:21.000
A huge function is to occur!

43:21.700 --> 43:23.120
Before he reaches the function...

43:25.500 --> 43:26.790
On the road! He should be killed!

43:29.950 --> 43:31.580
To reach the place where that function is happening...

43:31.750 --> 43:32.700
There are only two roads!

43:33.000 --> 43:33.830
The way I see it,

43:35.120 --> 43:36.450
He will enter from the main road only!

43:36.950 --> 43:37.620
It's a big road...

43:38.000 --> 43:39.040
Even people will be less there...

43:39.370 --> 43:40.500
There won't be any traffic congestion!

43:44.790 --> 43:45.660
Which is the other road?

43:46.330 --> 43:47.000
Those are small roads!

43:47.330 --> 43:48.620
Buildings all over,

43:48.620 --> 43:50.200
bus stop, market...

43:50.500 --> 43:51.700
No place to even move around!

43:52.040 --> 43:52.950
What I feel is...

43:53.330 --> 43:54.700
There is no chance of him taking that road!

43:56.200 --> 43:57.750
This function...
Where does it take place!

43:58.750 --> 44:00.160
In the DYSS new party office!

44:03.750 --> 44:04.290
MLA's,

44:04.290 --> 44:04.830
MP's,

44:04.830 --> 44:05.950
High Court Judges

44:05.950 --> 44:06.790
and Central Ministers

44:06.790 --> 44:07.830
everyone will be there!

44:07.830 --> 44:09.290
The security is now in the hands of the centre!

44:09.500 --> 44:10.700
The Chief Minister's name... Will be announced!

44:10.700 --> 44:11.120
Hey...

44:11.540 --> 44:12.700
Bring the lime man!

44:13.540 --> 44:15.330
The Chief Minister's name...
Will be announced!

44:15.660 --> 44:17.250
There... Touching him is also impossible!

44:21.450 --> 44:22.540
The one who is coming...
Do you have his photo!

44:25.000 --> 44:26.200
His photo is not needed!

44:27.080 --> 44:29.200
If he comes the whole of Bangalore will come to know!

44:36.620 --> 44:37.370
Reena!

44:37.370 --> 44:38.790
He will surely be caught!

44:38.870 --> 44:40.080
After we catch him!

44:42.290 --> 44:43.790
Henceforth you are my responsibility

44:43.790 --> 44:45.040
I will take good care of you...

44:45.040 --> 44:46.080
You have told this to my father... Right!

44:47.160 --> 44:48.370
Your are taking very good care of me!

44:48.370 --> 44:49.080
Kamal!

45:01.830 --> 45:02.450
Who are you??

45:06.790 --> 45:08.870
He has taken this very lightly sir! Andrews Sir..

45:10.250 --> 45:11.040
What is happening here??

45:11.040 --> 45:12.660
Who is going to come here??
He still has not realised...

45:12.660 --> 45:14.040
What is happening here??

45:14.870 --> 45:16.870
Who is coming here...
If he was aware!

45:17.750 --> 45:19.540
In this universe...
No one would have come!

45:21.500 --> 45:23.250
Let him do his work...

45:23.250 --> 45:25.410
Just keep him far away from Kamal, that's all!

45:29.200 --> 45:29.950
Two days ago,

45:29.950 --> 45:32.080
forty five boys have come to write an exam

45:32.080 --> 45:33.160
and are staying in Bell Hotel!

45:33.160 --> 45:35.410
Matching his personality
A lot of people are there, it seems...

45:35.660 --> 45:37.410
Since all the boys are in the hospital,

45:37.620 --> 45:39.080
there is no one to identify him!

45:41.500 --> 45:42.250
There is one person!

45:48.700 --> 45:50.040
Don't leave anybody out of the hotel,

45:50.040 --> 45:51.160
Every room should be checked!

45:52.620 --> 45:53.330
Get that door opened!

45:54.000 --> 45:54.450
What do you want??

45:54.450 --> 45:55.160
What's the matter??
- No

45:57.040 --> 45:57.660
Get that opened...

45:58.290 --> 45:58.830
No!

45:59.540 --> 46:00.160
No!

46:00.750 --> 46:01.160
Madam...

46:01.330 --> 46:01.830
Is it him?

46:02.200 --> 46:02.620
No!

46:02.620 --> 46:03.160
What about him??

46:05.120 --> 46:05.750
No!

46:09.790 --> 46:10.870
Hey! Who are you??

46:11.080 --> 46:11.540
Hey! Who are you??

46:11.660 --> 46:12.540
Who have you come from??

46:12.620 --> 46:14.160
What work do you have??
Tell me!

46:19.870 --> 46:20.700
You...

46:20.700 --> 46:21.500
Came...

46:21.500 --> 46:22.620
To see me...

46:23.160 --> 46:24.700
Even you weren't able to be away from me darling!

46:24.830 --> 46:26.410
There is no chance you will believe this!

46:26.500 --> 46:28.700
Just now I was thinking of you...
In the bathroom...

46:28.700 --> 46:29.580
I was having a bath!

46:29.790 --> 46:31.290
I'm going to kill you!

46:31.830 --> 46:34.000
I am already dead, my dearest!

46:34.450 --> 46:36.160
Now I like you all the more!

46:36.160 --> 46:38.500
You block the road to have a drink...

46:39.000 --> 46:40.330
To hit me up you come with boys...

46:40.330 --> 46:41.950
To the place where I am!

46:42.160 --> 46:44.450
You even threaten my life!

46:44.450 --> 46:46.080
Hey! Open the door!

46:46.080 --> 46:47.700
Now you are right next to me darling!

46:47.950 --> 46:48.540
My darling!

46:48.540 --> 46:50.000
I am like an express train...

46:50.330 --> 46:52.040
You are like the track!

46:52.040 --> 46:53.500
Both of us together...

46:53.500 --> 46:55.660
Can Chug along... Chug along!
Chug along!

46:55.660 --> 46:56.870
And keep going!

46:56.870 --> 46:57.660
Hey! Open the door!

46:57.660 --> 46:59.000
Hey! Who are you??

46:59.000 --> 47:00.040
Just a minute, my dear!

47:04.080 --> 47:05.660
When your sister and brother-in-law are in a room...

47:05.660 --> 47:06.660
They should not been disturbed!

47:06.660 --> 47:07.410
That much... Don't you guys know!

47:07.950 --> 47:08.660
What is it guys?!

47:09.080 --> 47:09.830
Hey!

47:09.830 --> 47:10.790
Hit him!

47:10.790 --> 47:11.790
Kill him! Hit him!

47:15.870 --> 47:16.790
Driver!

47:19.830 --> 47:21.370
Oh! God!

47:22.120 --> 47:23.200
Did you hit the driver too??

47:23.790 --> 47:25.330
Why do you get so upset about that, my dear!?

47:25.790 --> 47:26.660
I am here!

47:26.660 --> 47:27.700
Come, I will drop you!

47:28.040 --> 47:29.120
How is the Driver's attire looking on me dear?

47:29.120 --> 47:30.120
Are you impressed?

47:30.500 --> 47:31.830
I will also put on the Watchman's attire if you want!

47:31.950 --> 47:34.200
Even then, your driver has a lot of guts, my dear!

47:34.330 --> 47:35.160
Even after I hit so many people...

47:35.160 --> 47:36.160
Bravely he came in front of me!

47:36.580 --> 47:38.370
Henceforth like this...
Don't come out my dear!

47:38.370 --> 47:40.080
I understand the urgency...

47:40.080 --> 47:41.000
Let's get married soon!

47:41.200 --> 47:42.330
And after you get married!

47:42.330 --> 47:44.410
On the threshold I will not
make you kick the auspicious rice...

47:44.870 --> 47:46.120
I will keep a beer bottle there!

47:46.450 --> 47:47.830
You come and kick the bottle!

47:47.910 --> 47:49.000
Stop the car!

47:50.790 --> 47:51.540
What happened my dear??

47:51.540 --> 47:52.370
What happened??

47:52.370 --> 47:54.000
How dare you to talk to me like that...

47:54.160 --> 47:54.700
You idiot!

47:54.830 --> 47:56.500
You are not even worthy of standing in front of me!

47:56.660 --> 47:58.000
You have come and sat next to me!

47:58.330 --> 48:00.120
You are not aware of what my status is...

48:00.370 --> 48:02.700
A man like you... I will like??
How did you even imagine that?!

48:13.540 --> 48:16.040
After hitting four people you feel that you are a hero??

48:45.580 --> 48:46.500
You illiterate brute!

48:46.500 --> 48:47.330
One minute, my dear!

48:53.750 --> 48:54.660
What the hell man!

48:54.700 --> 48:55.700
Take out the car...

48:56.870 --> 48:57.910
Take out the Damn Car!

48:58.660 --> 48:59.410
Take it out... Man!

49:46.910 --> 49:50.250
If I polish eight boots then I would get a bun!

49:50.410 --> 49:52.620
The rice in a plate is spilt and eaten by such people...

49:52.620 --> 49:53.790
In their midst,

49:53.790 --> 49:55.370
the bun that has fallen in the mud...

49:55.370 --> 49:56.910
If you are struggling so much for it...

49:56.910 --> 49:59.160
Your situation I can understand!

49:59.450 --> 50:02.000
Selfishness is making the world go around!

50:02.450 --> 50:04.160
It won't stop for anyone!

50:04.500 --> 50:06.580
We have to hold and stop it...

50:09.750 --> 50:11.500
Don't worry about them!

50:12.250 --> 50:14.370
None of them are as strong as you are,

50:15.790 --> 50:19.410
in this entire universe there is no soldier...
Better than a mother!

50:51.660 --> 50:53.250
Darling you were telling me something, my dear!

51:00.580 --> 51:01.620
Take me to your home!

51:02.950 --> 51:03.950
OK!

51:27.580 --> 51:28.580
Someone came in between...
See that!

51:28.580 --> 51:29.620
Clear that vehicle...

51:30.660 --> 51:31.700
Hey! Take the vehicle out!

52:06.450 --> 52:06.750
Sir...

52:07.370 --> 52:08.160
Greetings...

52:08.160 --> 52:09.120
My name is Anand Ingalgi...

52:09.410 --> 52:10.580
I had called you earlier...

52:10.580 --> 52:11.290
I am a journalist...

52:11.950 --> 52:13.910
Whatever I ask about him...
No one even dares to speak about sir...

52:13.910 --> 52:14.910
At least if you could...
- Come inside!

52:16.540 --> 52:17.660
You don't worry sir

52:17.660 --> 52:18.700
Your name will not be published in the paper!

52:20.000 --> 52:21.330
Put my name prominently

52:21.330 --> 52:22.160
Nagaraju...

52:22.160 --> 52:23.620
Son of Kalidas...

52:23.750 --> 52:24.250
Write it down!

52:25.330 --> 52:26.080
Now ask me...

52:26.410 --> 52:26.830
Sir...

52:27.080 --> 52:28.330
Before he became a Rowdy

52:28.580 --> 52:31.000
When he was in Bombay
He had a different name, I heard...

52:31.000 --> 52:32.660
Raja Krishna Beria

52:33.200 --> 52:34.410
How did it become Rocky sir...

52:34.910 --> 52:36.330
Day... mond!

52:36.540 --> 52:38.830
Since 1925

52:39.540 --> 52:40.160
What does that mean?

52:40.160 --> 52:42.000
It means... The year the Company was formed!

52:42.000 --> 52:43.040
Why do they put it thus?

52:43.040 --> 52:44.580
For Brands... That is what they do!

52:45.580 --> 52:46.250
A Brand means?

52:46.580 --> 52:48.040
The name has a value...

52:48.290 --> 52:49.830
That all will know about!

52:50.250 --> 52:52.950
At a very young age, he decided to become a Brand...

52:53.160 --> 52:53.950
A Brand?

52:55.250 --> 52:56.700
I will tell you about an incident, listen...

52:57.910 --> 53:00.410
Sir, he has driven the vehicle rashly at 100 Km speed,

53:00.500 --> 53:01.910
he has even smashed the Check-post!

53:02.000 --> 53:02.870
Neither are the vehicle documents there,

53:02.870 --> 53:03.580
nor is the license...

53:03.830 --> 53:04.500
He has called someone...

53:04.500 --> 53:05.870
To bring the documents, I think!

53:06.080 --> 53:07.660
When you ask his name,
he is not saying that too!

53:09.120 --> 53:10.040
Do you have matches?

53:11.370 --> 53:13.160
In my Station, you are smoking in front of me?

53:13.160 --> 53:14.330
He screamed at thunder itself...

53:14.330 --> 53:15.580
Who cares for your riches!

53:15.750 --> 53:17.330
Whoever you might be,
yoou are first a slave of law!

53:17.330 --> 53:17.950
A slave!

53:18.160 --> 53:19.620
To even say your name,
you are acting smart!

53:19.750 --> 53:21.200
Speak up!

53:21.200 --> 53:22.160
He thundered once...

53:22.160 --> 53:23.660
I will set you right!
You rogue!

53:24.540 --> 53:26.540
The whole Station shook!

53:47.750 --> 53:49.000
The Driving License...

53:53.450 --> 53:54.700
Hey... Give a chair!

53:55.290 --> 53:57.950
Where is it?!

53:59.500 --> 54:00.750
Found it!

54:01.620 --> 54:03.660
Even though many had not seen him,

54:03.660 --> 54:04.910
his name was known to all...

54:08.450 --> 54:09.700
Rocky!

54:20.580 --> 54:21.410
Since...

54:25.040 --> 54:26.950
Sir...
He is such a big criminal brand...

54:26.950 --> 54:28.500
How do you accept that?

54:28.500 --> 54:30.450
I have put a golden ring to that hand of law...

54:30.870 --> 54:32.540
It will shake hands with me,

54:32.950 --> 54:34.500
and will salute me too!

54:34.660 --> 54:36.790
Police whistled and caught a Rowdy,

54:37.080 --> 54:40.000
but people whistled and cheered for him
and he became a king!

54:40.870 --> 54:42.000
After they accepted...

54:42.330 --> 54:43.910
Not a slave...

54:43.910 --> 54:45.330
Who are we to deny it?

54:45.330 --> 54:46.830
The Chief!

54:50.000 --> 55:08.620
The King! The King!

55:08.620 --> 55:09.250
Sir...

55:10.290 --> 55:11.580
You have gone ahead in the story!

55:13.620 --> 55:14.450
How far ahead have I gone?

55:14.870 --> 55:16.160
Too far ahead...

55:30.200 --> 55:31.540
When did I ask for a coffee...

55:31.620 --> 55:32.500
Kindly excuse me madam!

55:39.080 --> 55:40.830
Rocky's curiosity was piqued!

55:41.580 --> 55:44.290
The marked trucks that were supposed to be in the Bombay Port,

55:44.290 --> 55:47.290
what were they doing in Bangalore under police protection??

55:47.870 --> 55:49.540
This inexplicable secret that he did not fathom!

55:49.540 --> 55:50.410
He went behind it!

56:17.870 --> 56:18.620
In Bombay,

56:18.620 --> 56:22.160
the boxes of gold could never have gone past Rocky.

56:22.910 --> 56:24.750
Rocky, who was only concerned with opening the seal,

56:25.160 --> 56:28.000
never bothered to think about the
hands that sealed the boxes.

56:29.120 --> 56:31.450
Seeing those boxes in this godown,

56:31.450 --> 56:32.950
one thing was confirmed to him!

56:32.950 --> 56:35.750
The gold was not coming from Africa!

56:36.290 --> 56:38.500
More than worrying about why this secrecy,

56:38.500 --> 56:40.160
the only thing that remained in his head was,

56:40.750 --> 56:42.660
where was this Gold coming from

56:42.870 --> 56:45.370
and whose hands were behind this!!

56:48.790 --> 56:50.950
Breaking news! DYSS Party has...

56:50.950 --> 56:51.950
In the State elections

56:51.950 --> 56:53.910
In Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka

56:53.910 --> 56:55.910
For the fifth consecutive time, has recorded a win!

56:55.910 --> 56:59.120
Under the leadership of Gurupandiyan,
this party's flag that flew high

56:59.120 --> 57:01.160
shows no signs of coming down again!

57:04.540 --> 57:05.660
The Election Results have come in,

57:05.660 --> 57:06.580
the time is too short...

57:06.580 --> 57:08.910
But only the CM's name is being
announced in this small function,

57:08.910 --> 57:11.370
will he take the risk and surely come to
Bangalore for this, what is the guarantee?

57:11.370 --> 57:14.410
To call him from there, there is just one idea,

57:14.410 --> 57:16.160
first we have to cater to his ego!

57:17.040 --> 57:17.660
How?

57:17.660 --> 57:19.660
Make a statue of his father!

57:19.660 --> 57:20.450
A statue?

57:20.450 --> 57:22.450
Placing it in front of the party office

57:22.450 --> 57:24.540
and announce that we are inaugurating it...

57:24.540 --> 57:25.790
He will come without fail!

57:25.790 --> 57:27.330
Till he is inside that fort,

57:27.330 --> 57:29.040
No one can touch him!

57:31.830 --> 57:33.410
Even then if he does venture out,

57:33.540 --> 57:35.450
It will not mean that has no army!

57:39.830 --> 57:40.700
Hey... Lay off!

57:40.700 --> 57:42.700
If Brother is not there,
you will keep fighting amongst yourselves!

57:44.790 --> 57:45.580
Vaanaram sir!

57:45.580 --> 57:46.250
John,

57:46.250 --> 57:48.500
the young master will surely go to Bangalore!

57:48.500 --> 57:49.910
You too should leave for there!

57:51.540 --> 57:52.540
Don't forget...

57:52.620 --> 57:54.330
This will be our last chance!

57:54.330 --> 57:55.830
Your Bombay shooter....

57:56.120 --> 57:57.200
Is he ready?

58:03.250 --> 58:04.500
Where is she?

58:06.080 --> 58:07.330
Where is she?

58:25.250 --> 58:27.750
Be cautious!

58:27.750 --> 58:31.200
I'm a lightning like vine...

58:31.200 --> 58:35.080
Eyes like the edge of a sword!

58:35.080 --> 58:38.830
In the trap, it's when you fall...

58:38.830 --> 58:41.950
Will you realize this plot!

58:42.000 --> 58:44.250
Be cautious!

58:44.250 --> 58:47.950
I'm a lightning like vine...

58:47.950 --> 58:51.830
Eyes like the edge of a sword!

58:51.830 --> 58:55.580
In the trap, it's when you fall...

58:55.580 --> 58:58.700
Will you realize this plot!

59:14.620 --> 59:17.160
When the slender waist gyrates,

59:17.160 --> 59:18.950
When it swings!

59:18.950 --> 59:21.700
You be ecstatic then!

59:21.700 --> 59:24.330
The arrows of mischievous smile...

59:24.330 --> 59:26.330
When they hit you, you clever one!

59:26.330 --> 59:29.370
You will be my prisoner then!

59:29.370 --> 59:31.910
When the slender waist gyrates,

59:31.910 --> 59:33.700
When it swings!

59:33.700 --> 59:36.450
You be ecstatic then!

59:36.450 --> 59:39.080
The arrows of mischievous smile...

59:39.080 --> 59:41.080
When they hit you, you clever one!

59:41.080 --> 59:44.120
You will be my prisoner then!

59:44.120 --> 59:45.950
A beautiful wife,

59:45.950 --> 59:48.040
Is like a honey bee sucking nectar!

59:48.040 --> 59:48.580
But...

59:48.580 --> 59:49.660
Later...

59:49.660 --> 59:50.580
When you feel the intoxication...

59:50.580 --> 59:51.580
It slows down, it slows down!

59:51.580 --> 59:53.370
Be cautious!

59:53.370 --> 59:57.080
I'm a lightning like vine...

59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.950
Eyes like the edge of a sword!

01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:04.620
In the trap, it's when you fall...

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:07.750
Will you realize this plot!

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.290
Rocky has come to the pub!

01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:19.500
What is Rocky doing there?

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:26.250
The situation has gone beyond control!

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:27.830
You have to come now!

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.660
What is it that you are searching for?

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:36.540
Look at my beauty...

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:39.330
A woman more beautiful than me, do you need?

01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:42.080
Before taking a step,

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.870
Look at me once again...

01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:46.750
Understand my signals, my darling!

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:49.250
What is it that you are searching for?

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:51.120
Look at my beauty...

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.910
A woman more beautiful than me, do you need?

01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:56.660
Before taking a step,

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.450
Look at me once again...

01:00:58.450 --> 01:01:01.330
Understand my signals, my darling!

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:02.370
Alert...

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.410
Alert...

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:05.330
The lamp is extinguished... There is darkness!

01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:07.000
In the trap of the vine...

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.080
Lets escape and run...
Slowly... Slowly!

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.080
Be cautious!

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.790
I'm a lightning like vine...

01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:18.660
Eyes like the edge of a sword!

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:22.410
In the trap, it's when you fall...

01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:25.540
Will you realize this plot!

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:37.330
This guy...

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:39.200
You gave such a build-up for this guy?

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.250
By him...
You guys even got beaten up!

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.000
I don't know where you came from!

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.040
After coming to Bangalore,

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.500
where is Vidhana Soudha...

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.830
How is the weather here,
before finding out about these...

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.790
How bad I am, that you should have found out!

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.250
You made a mistake!

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.540
And now it's too late!

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.620
Don't waste a bullet!

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:09.040
He is not worth it!

01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:13.160
Do you know why I called all of them?

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.580
Not to get you hit up!

01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:17.200
To merely show you your worth!

01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:19.080
To even aspire,

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.700
you need to be worthy!

01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:22.290
That too a girl like me...

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.500
Still I will give you an opportunity!

01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:27.910
To your manhood!

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.830
In front of all of them,
if you come and touch me,

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.080
I will be yours!

01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:53.540
Hey!

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:54.870
Go, go away man...

01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:56.200
Get the hell out!

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.700
You need guts dude!

01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:58.950
Get going! Get going!

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:00.750
Hey kid!

01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:02.370
Go to Balepet and tell my name!

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:04.870
Two dozen bangles will be given to you,
in my uncle's shop!

01:03:16.330 --> 01:03:17.620
Do you have a match box!

01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:32.250
Petrol...

01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:18.040
Those who love are high on jealousy...
It is said so...

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:22.540
Everyone who puts his
finger on the trigger is not a shooter!

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:25.000
Everyone who lays his hand
on a girl is not a man!

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.290
What is my worth...

01:04:27.290 --> 01:04:28.750
Other than those who love me,

01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:30.200
it won't be understood by anyone else!

01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:39.080
Hey... Where is that Balepete Bangle seller?

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.660
In my uncle's shops

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:42.620
Without customers, the business had become dull,

01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:44.250
That's why I was promoting it...

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.450
Sorry brother!

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.500
And then...

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.160
Who is that who said I need guts?

01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:52.000
I love you darling!

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.500
You gave me a great idea!

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.750
He who plans to visit a city,

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:01.700
finds out about it!

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:04.290
He who comes to rule the city!

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:07.450
Informs the city about who he is!

01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:10.950
If you think you are bad...

01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:12.910
I am your Dad!

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:14.080
You...
- Kamal!

01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:24.700
My father-in-law come!

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:28.750
Everybody out...

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.830
You got saved man!

01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:39.040
They came, not to save me, you dumbo...

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.290
But to save you from me!

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:45.950
Who is he??

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:49.950
He is the one who has come to kill Garuda!

01:05:51.330 --> 01:05:52.330
This chap?

01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:53.790
Why were you called??

01:05:53.790 --> 01:05:54.950
And what are you doing??

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:57.200
I don't want people who put my words in their ears!

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.910
I wanted those who will put it in their minds!

01:05:58.910 --> 01:06:01.410
That why I came to Rajendra Desai's Pub

01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:04.370
and made Rajendra Desai to come!

01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:06.950
What have you planned?

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:09.120
Garuda will come only in the second road!

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.620
On the road where there are more people...

01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:14.120
The newly opened shops,

01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:16.750
The customers who move around there...

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.700
In the houses nearby the people

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.160
who have just taken places for rent...

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:23.370
Since many days,
the damaged vehicles which have been parked there!

01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:24.540
The empty taxis...

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.620
Every single person out there are his own men!

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:28.200
We can't kill him there!

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:28.910
Then??

01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:31.700
I will kill him inside the DYSS Party Office itself!

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:33.370
What are you saying??

01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:34.870
In that road there will be police...

01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:36.250
Even in the gate there will be cops...

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.580
Even Ministers will be checked there!

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:41.580
The young master is coming,

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:42.950
Everybody has to be checked!

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.580
You are planning to kill him inside??

01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:48.120
We too will be checked!

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.620
He will also be checked...

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.790
Inside... If in my hands, I get a gun!

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:57.120
The gun...

01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:58.580
You will surely get!

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.830
Having erected the statue and laid the bait!

01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:10.750
They were waiting for Garuda!

01:09:57.250 --> 01:10:00.660
My father has believed all of you a lot!

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:03.500
To maintain that, on his behalf...

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:04.870
I have come all the way here!

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:17.040
My father has built a huge kingdom itself!

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.790
I will build a kingdom much bigger than that!

01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:36.620
The statue they had build was Suryavardhan's...

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.330
But what was installed there...

01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:39.620
Was Garuda's!

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:15.660
Let's go... Let's go...

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:19.250
He didn't kill him?

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.120
Does that mean that your hero failed?

01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:23.750
He lost!

01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:26.330
Now what will your hero do??

01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:27.450
Will he give up??

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:30.500
The wounded lion's breath...

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.370
Is far more terrifying than his roar!

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.250
What do you mean??

01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:38.750
Page 128...

01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:42.120
Taking a lot of trouble,
I have written a poem...

01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:44.080
Have you locked the gate,

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:45.950
Have you called some security?

01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:47.500
Don't allow anybody inside!

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.910
He won't kill that easily!

01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:52.620
He will shoot and hang him in front of Vidhana Soudha!

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:56.160
After a lot of thought, to get one gun inside,

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.080
If we struggled so much...

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:57.910
To protect,

01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:59.290
A whole army was inundated out there!

01:11:59.290 --> 01:12:01.790
In those, half the people who lifted their guns...

01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:03.410
All these days, I thought they were our men!

01:12:03.410 --> 01:12:04.620
Where is that guy from Bombay?

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.000
He is inside!

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.450
We thought if we kill him,

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.790
If we kill him when we thought that,
that place would become ours!

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.910
The heaven that we live in,
We have converted it into a graveyard!

01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:18.950
Under the impression that we can rule some world!

01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:20.370
The entire world!

01:12:24.330 --> 01:12:25.290
But...

01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:27.790
Why did he spare us?

01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:30.040
Power...

01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:36.120
He can kill us whenever he pleases!

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.950
But he had come to show the world what his power was!

01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:43.040
Now he is waiting for his father to die!

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:45.000
There is very little time!

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.750
If Garuda does not die now,

01:12:47.290 --> 01:12:49.250
we will all die for sure!

01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:51.750
If so,

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:54.540
will you go there?

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:57.200
To that place?

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.290
In their midst?

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.750
Can someone dare to go to that hell?

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.000
Can you even think of that??

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.540
The blow that he has given us here,

01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:14.790
No one will even think of going there!

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:26.790
The burning igneous chest...

01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:28.200
Sweating in rampant fear!

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:32.080
Boiling meteors scattered in the sky!

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:36.620
The rest seems to have been burnt!

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:38.250
In a fight,

01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:40.830
who hits first is not what is counted...

01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:48.410
Who falls down first is what clinches the fight!

01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:55.120
The one you have called me to kill...

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.700
Without killing him, I will not go back!

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.700
Wherever the place is,

01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:02.750
However it is,

01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:04.790
I will go right there and kill him!

01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:11.950
The waves are waiting for the earth to embrace...

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:19.410
The sun waits with patience to set in the sky!

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:26.950
Thunder and lightning are overriding the hillock!

01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:29.500
To it's own writing...

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.370
Go man!

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:33.660
Fate too shivers!

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.240
Why all this for me, Mother?

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.540
I don't believe in God.

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:54.540
You believe me, don't you?

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:05.370
Don't ever lose this.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.120
Hello...

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:25.790
Get a map ready.

01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:36.040
The map you asked for.

01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:38.700
Once you go there, our contact will be cut.

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:41.540
The map in your hand contains only half the information.

01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:43.660
You will have to fill in the rest once you get there.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.370
Once you get set there, give us a signal,

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:48.410
a big one...

01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:50.660
There is only one way to get there.

01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:54.490
John has sent trucks to a town...

01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:57.160
to catch people like fish in a net.

01:15:57.620 --> 01:15:59.450
You have to go and get inside one of those trucks.

01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:03.700
But before that there are trained killers
surrounding the entire town with barricades...

01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:05.740
You have to cross them.

01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:13.370
Sir...

01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:15.620
Did you find out anything about Rocky?

01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:16.240
Hey!

01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:18.700
Hey... Kiddo!
Bring hot tea for Shetty Boss.

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:19.700
Father,

01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:22.950
where has Rocky gone?

01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:28.870
Since 25 years...

01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:30.990
I have been working for him!

01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:33.660
I don't know about him all that well...

01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:36.410
Uncle... Will you say it or should I?

01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:38.790
But theirs is a huge forest.

01:16:41.370 --> 01:16:42.120
That guy,

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.200
her lover.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.540
he will not return from the place he has gone to...

01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:47.990
Will you tell her that?

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.240
Or should I?

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:57.240
Here, among the sheep...
Rocky was like a Ram...

01:16:59.870 --> 01:17:01.540
But in that forest,

01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:03.330
he is just an insect!

01:17:09.330 --> 01:17:11.580
Don't worry about him, Uncle...

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:12.540
He's gone!

01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:14.040
He will never return!

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.330
Hey! No man...

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:16.990
I'm not worried about Rocky...

01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:19.950
Day before yesterday, when he visited me,
he brought sweetmeats for the kids.

01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:21.200
The kids loved it...

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.080
Just wanted to know where he bought that from!

01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:25.080
Don't worry about him, man...

01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:26.540
You know about him...

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:28.370
Don't you sir?

01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:32.740
Hey... Sit down,
sit down all of you...

01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:35.160
Hey... Fill them up in the trucks...

01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:42.080
Someone is walking towards you...

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.080
Towards us?

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:44.990
Let him come...

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.580
He will not be allowed to leave...

01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:47.740
He is not going out...

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:48.990
He is barging his way in...

01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:49.620
What??

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:52.910
Once he catches the track, it's fixed!

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.410
Neither does he stop, nor does he bow down...

01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:12.370
He is blessed...

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.580
Wonder who's son this adamant lad is...

01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:37.830
Rocky is like fire...

01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:39.200
Enemy...

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:40.040
Petrol...

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.200
As the number of enemies increase...

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.040
He burns brighter...

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:11.080
You mentioned that he had gone to some forest...

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.910
Please do not go there...

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:20.200
I promise on God...

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.040
The forest will catch fire...

01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:33.160
Boss, the tea is cold...

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:36.080
Hey kiddo...
Bring a hot cup of tea for sir...

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:39.830
Today I have to give my kids Rasgulla...

01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:44.410
Go inside...

01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:41.330
Hey... What happened...

01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:42.120
Who's it??

01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:44.990
One guy...

01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:55.290
They must have died fighting each other...

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.870
First send the trucks...

01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:14.910
They are waiting...

01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:18.660
He has left...

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:26.040
He did not know about the road he had taken...

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:33.410
He had no knowledge of his destination...

01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:42.160
Nor did he know about the monstrous history...

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:46.790
Suryavardhan had grown to heights
where none could touch him

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.080
but a day after his fall...

01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:53.580
The shouts of his heirs echoed.

01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:55.700
You have built this kingdom with a lot of effort...

01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:57.120
He had to select someone...

01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.910
Tell... Who should rule after you...??

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.080
Your son Garuda...

01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:01.330
Or brother Adheera...

01:23:01.330 --> 01:23:02.830
Adheera...

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:10.830
Brother!

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:16.490
Here politics and deceit was stronger than a million swords...

01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:19.990
You do not know either...

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.540
Like how,
without a desire for KGF,

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:25.370
you were standing behind me...

01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:28.080
Like that you should stand next to Garuda...

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:29.990
Hey...

01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:34.080
Once brother commands...
No more discussions!

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:37.410
Till Garuda is around...
I will not desire this position...

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:40.740
That single decision,

01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:44.200
shook the very foundation of the fortress built by him...

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:49.240
Adheera attacked Garuda...

01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:51.870
He missed his target...

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:56.080
Garuda attacked Adheera...

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:00.120
He did not miss his mark...

01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:08.080
Garuda took over the reign

01:24:08.490 --> 01:24:10.870
and began to rule the entire KGF...

01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:19.330
but he was well aware that
there were many people who desired KGF...

01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:21.700
Although he knew he had enemies next to him...

01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:27.160
He took an oath to wait till his father was alive
and then destroy his enemies...

01:25:41.490 --> 01:25:43.950
To protect his empire,
Suryavardhan

01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:47.490
had selected three forms of security.

01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:49.200
One was a huge wall...

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:54.990
A huge door...

01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:06.040
And to protect these two,
a ruthless Commander-in-Chief!

01:26:08.290 --> 01:26:09.200
Vaanaram...

01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:19.040
201 men,

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.080
15 women...

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.700
total 216 people...

01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:21.990
Yes...

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.160
This years...

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:27.040
It is the 41st batch!

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:29.910
Put them to work...

01:26:33.870 --> 01:26:36.540
After spilling a lot of blood Suryavardhan had built this fort,

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.200
he had only one worry!

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:44.290
That no one should enter this place
and spill a drop of his blood...

01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:51.040
Suryavardhan called this place Naraachi...

01:26:51.490 --> 01:26:52.790
Naraachi means

01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:54.330
the Goldsmith's weighing scale on which,

01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:57.160
he placed intelligence on one side

01:26:57.450 --> 01:27:01.290
and fear on the other and equalized it!

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:31.160
The new dogs have arrived.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:32.410
Take them...

01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:46.660
Brother... When will they send us from here?

01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:49.660
Since 20 years...
I have been asking the same question!

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:01.540
He has come...

01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:03.240
He has come...
I told you... I told you...

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.200
He would rescue us all.
- You say the same thing about everyone who comes here...

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:07.080
He... He... Will save us.
- Get going... Get going

01:28:12.450 --> 01:28:13.950
Who hit him??

01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:14.990
I did brother...

01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:22.160
Apply tincher on his wounds and give him some food...

01:28:24.370 --> 01:28:26.450
He murders on the one hand

01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:28.040
and on the other shows compassion...

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.620
I'm unable to understand my brother.

01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:30.580
Compassion??

01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:32.740
You have just returned from London.

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:34.740
You will understand more as time goes by...

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.740
He said that these three people have to be well taken care of,

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:38.410
they who had come to kill Garuda...

01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:40.370
Do you know why he has kept them alive?

01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:42.580
This time for the procession of the Goddess,

01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:44.040
Rams have not been brought...

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.080
So?

01:29:58.660 --> 01:29:59.990
You have all recently come here

01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:03.330
but there is no time for anyone to wipe their tears...

01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:05.540
You've learnt how to bow your heads down...

01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:07.410
There is still a lot to learn...

01:30:07.410 --> 01:30:09.080
You arrived yesterday?

01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:10.990
You arrived yesterday?

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.740
Which movie was released?

01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:14.790
Which movie was released?

01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:16.240
Don't you know?

01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:17.620
Don't you know?

01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:18.660
Go away!

01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:20.040
Go away!

01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:30.080
We have been brought here

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.240
for mining...

01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:04.540
Everyday we have to work in a 12 hour shift...

01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:07.990
No one should raise their heads and look at the guards...

01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:12.490
They do not tolerate being looked at...

01:31:14.490 --> 01:31:15.620
They will shoot you...

01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:44.330
You will work 900 feet below ground...

01:31:51.490 --> 01:31:53.790
You will be a little scared on the first day...

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.870
Forget the outside world...

01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:22.450
Come outside...

01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:24.120
Come...

01:32:27.870 --> 01:32:28.990
Blasting....

01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:43.950
It's done, come for work!

01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:54.080
Instead of working...

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:55.830
Hey... Hey... He's a newcomer...

01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:56.700
A newcomer...

01:32:56.910 --> 01:32:57.620
I will tell him...

01:32:57.790 --> 01:32:58.870
Work, work!

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.700
Do you want to die on the first day of your job?

01:33:07.290 --> 01:33:08.490
What were you doing?

01:33:08.910 --> 01:33:10.540
What were you doing outside?

01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:13.660
Construction work!

01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:16.790
The wounds on the upper part of your palms tell me...

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:18.700
About the work you were doing outside...

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.950
The sooner you learn the ways and methods of this place,

01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:27.950
the better it will be for you...

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:37.490
Sorry...

01:33:50.210 --> 01:33:52.080
In the trucks that reached here day before yesterday,

01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:54.000
Before Batch number 49 reaches here...

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.210
An incident happened in John's gang!

01:33:56.370 --> 01:33:57.250
Ramana told me about it...

01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:58.210
What happened?

01:33:58.370 --> 01:33:59.960
Our boys always squabbled with each other...

01:34:00.370 --> 01:34:01.910
But don't know what happened this time,

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:03.830
they have fought and killed each other!

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.620
Is no one alive amongst them?

01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:07.330
Only one was alive when I came...

01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:09.080
Did he say anything?

01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:10.410
While breathing his last,
he said, 'One man...'

01:34:10.710 --> 01:34:11.660
I did not understand anything!

01:34:12.210 --> 01:34:13.250
One man?

01:34:14.830 --> 01:34:15.460
Vanaram sir...

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:16.540
Sir!

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.120
One man!

01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:44.410
We are playing a game of chess

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.040
But we seem to be playing with just a pawn!

01:34:49.710 --> 01:34:51.000
We have guards at the gate...

01:34:54.250 --> 01:34:55.660
We have guards at the Mining...

01:34:58.870 --> 01:35:00.370
We have guards at the watch tower...

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:04.790
We have guards on the walls too!

01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:08.660
Garuda's guards!

01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:14.290
You don't worry!

01:35:14.290 --> 01:35:16.370
We all have ample security!

01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:19.620
Even if the security was very tight,
Rocky has to cross Biligiri

01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:22.500
and enter the house through
a tunnel near one of the watch towers

01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:23.710
And kill Garuda...

01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:26.290
We have only given Rocky the blueprints of the house

01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:30.120
But he has to find out under which Watch tower the tunnel is!

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:32.370
How will he find it?

01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:33.960
Maintenance room...

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:39.660
All the information in Narachi will be got right there!

01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:42.830
No one is permitted without scrutiny!

01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:43.290
Hey...

01:35:43.290 --> 01:35:44.290
Stand right there!

01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:48.080
But the highest security is at that place!

01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:50.830
Then how?

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.370
In a sea of blood there will be more bloodshed...

01:35:56.370 --> 01:35:57.710
The blood of Ram's will flow...

01:35:57.710 --> 01:36:00.410
People are saying that this time they will
sacrifice three men instead of Rams!

01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:02.250
When electricity goes off here!

01:36:02.250 --> 01:36:05.460
The guards coming rushing in... From everywhere!

01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:07.540
I don't know how...

01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:09.210
Even though all the guards have Walkies with them,

01:36:09.210 --> 01:36:11.460
at times they will be suffering due to lack of signal!

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:15.620
Crossing many Mines Rocky had reached Narachi

01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:18.580
and was trying to learn about it!

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:24.410
If 20,000 workers

01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:27.500
were to be monitered by 400 guards,

01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:32.250
the rules governing them had to be extreme!

01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:39.250
Due to what happened that day,
Rocky...

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:42.160
became one among the people there!

01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:02.000
Shankra...

01:38:00.370 --> 01:38:02.290
Leave my place...

01:38:02.290 --> 01:38:04.500
I will hold it...
Leave that to me...

01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:07.120
Leave it!
This is my place...

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:21.500
The day after they find out that he is blind,

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:24.040
he will have to be buried!

01:38:26.370 --> 01:38:29.120
Hey... Put the mud...

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:30.960
Put it... Put it,

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.710
Put it guys... Put it!

01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:38.000
If they realise that you are unfit to work, that's it!

01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:45.500
Rugga will enter!

01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:11.540
He could not even shoot the guy next to him!

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:38.040
People put animals in cages,

01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:42.250
but here animals have put people in cages...

01:39:42.250 --> 01:39:44.750
Here there is neither heaven nor hell...

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:46.960
Nor is there good or bad...

01:39:47.290 --> 01:39:48.870
No beliefs at all!

01:39:50.290 --> 01:39:54.160
But Rugga was just a small replica of Garuda!

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:57.210
Don't get sucked in by emotions!

01:39:57.210 --> 01:39:58.750
There is no value for them here!

01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:03.750
That will not affect the stone-hearted!

01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:06.500
I am just understanding the ways of the world here...

01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:10.370
Only two people were standing firm in Narachi...

01:40:14.370 --> 01:40:15.910
Those scoundrels will never be sensible,

01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:18.330
They have klilled the mother and son,
just because they crossed Biligere!

01:40:18.330 --> 01:40:20.710
Don't give any of them food today!

01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:22.870
The rest of the people lives

01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:24.410
seemed to be have been uprooted!

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:25.500
Hey...

01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:26.790
Call Kencha....

01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:28.410
let him tell a story,

01:40:29.370 --> 01:40:31.210
the children will stop crying out of hunger!

01:40:31.710 --> 01:40:33.870
But in a place where beliefs were dead,

01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:35.830
a mad man...

01:40:36.910 --> 01:40:38.960
was narrating stories that he had created...

01:40:39.250 --> 01:40:41.830
Hey... You always repeat the same thing!

01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:43.460
Tell us some story!

01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:45.250
You have seen so many movies,

01:40:45.250 --> 01:40:46.830
daily you tell us a different story...

01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:49.960
Tell us a story!

01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:54.250
I will tell you the story of that forest...

01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:57.620
I will tell you the story of that hero!

01:40:57.620 --> 01:40:59.250
The story of the hero!

01:41:00.410 --> 01:41:02.910
In the direction of Modana under the hill

01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:04.790
was a beautiful forest...

01:41:05.250 --> 01:41:07.410
Soft hearted tribals lived

01:41:07.410 --> 01:41:09.750
in the midst of lush Sandlewood!!

01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:11.710
Hope you have a beautiful bonny boy baby!

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:12.620
Hey granny...

01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:13.580
Why a baby boy?

01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:14.580
I want a baby girl only!

01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:15.540
Bless me again!

01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:17.000
Fine... Fine...
May you have a girl baby!

01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.960
A rain of fire fell in the forest!

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:25.370
The blaze of thunder...
Wherever you see!

01:41:27.370 --> 01:41:28.410
Which shift have they given you?

01:41:28.410 --> 01:41:29.120
Night shift!

01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:31.460
They have given me the morning shift!

01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:32.540
Wait, I will ask them and come!

01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:33.500
No, don't go!

01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:34.870
Don't know what they will do...

01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:36.210
You please don't go!

01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:39.460
Who will look after you now?

01:41:40.830 --> 01:41:43.330
Lush forests have become wastelands!

01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:44.620
May you have a boy baby, dear...

01:41:44.910 --> 01:41:45.620
Why?

01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:47.160
Has no one told you?

01:41:47.370 --> 01:41:48.660
How it is in this place?

01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:50.580
If a girl baby is born here...

01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:52.330
We ourselves kill it!

01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:56.290
Oh! God!

01:41:57.210 --> 01:41:58.370
Let me have a baby boy please!

01:41:59.750 --> 01:42:01.290
Let me have a baby boy please!

01:42:02.330 --> 01:42:05.000
It became a graveyard of innocent lives!

01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:10.290
Why have you kept all the ration there?

01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:13.250
See what will happen now!

01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:14.710
Hey...

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:16.210
Take away the rations!

01:42:18.410 --> 01:42:22.830
The wretched demons who suck
the hot blood of poor people...

01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:27.330
Cruel devils who cut the body
and devour the flesh!

01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:34.250
The breath too has sucked

01:42:34.250 --> 01:42:36.160
the lives of the poor souls...

01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:39.370
With self-respect I carried the body

01:42:39.370 --> 01:42:41.250
and reached the graveyard!

01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:44.000
The sagging gait and the bent head!

01:42:44.290 --> 01:42:46.000
A fistfull of curses in destiny's writings...

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:51.080
Made them lose faith in the creator!

01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:54.960
Made them lose their very faith!

01:43:08.370 --> 01:43:09.620
But...

01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:15.040
Cutting the creator's chains...

01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:17.370
Broadening the chest with pride

01:43:17.370 --> 01:43:19.960
As the Lord who nips the lives of the raging demons!

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:21.790
The belief of those who were oppressed and deppressed!

01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:24.620
Was borne by a great mother!

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:29.250
In the womb, as you contain me...

01:43:29.250 --> 01:43:31.960
In the town, as you walk...

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:37.120
Seems like you are majestically sitting in a chariot...
Oh! Mother!

01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:41.000
When I felt a ghost nearing me,

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.460
and was transfixed with fright

01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:48.710
You made my mind free of fear...
Oh! Mother!

01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:53.080
To the unseen God...

01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:56.000
I refuse to pay obeisance with folded hands...

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.870
To you, my life's breath itself
is the ritual of worship!

01:44:08.210 --> 01:44:09.750
I can't take it anymore!

01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:17.620
After you are born

01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:20.250
you should become a strong man...

01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:22.540
You should look after me...

01:44:24.410 --> 01:44:26.330
For those who are in trouble like me...

01:44:29.410 --> 01:44:31.120
You should look after those people...

01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:37.210
Come fast my dear...

01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:39.410
Come fast!

01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:41.000
Scattered... Scared and sweating,

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.290
when the very moons
were hiding under the shield of the saree...

01:44:44.290 --> 01:44:47.540
A fiery woman gave birth to a volcano then!

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.870
Like the rains that pour incessently in the blazing rains!

01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:05.660
Like he who conquered death in the house of death!

01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:08.710
Like a rebellion in the face of riches!

01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:11.210
Like a fatal bow facing a ten headed demon!

01:45:11.290 --> 01:45:13.660
Beyond the inherent anger in him

01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:16.460
Saying 'I am everything'
And questioning the very creator!

01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:17.580
He who thundered

01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:18.960
This is the story of one such hero!

01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:22.040
The story of a brave-heart who went beyond destiny!

01:45:23.330 --> 01:45:24.040
Then...

01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:26.750
What happened to him?

01:45:33.330 --> 01:45:35.580
I will be alive till I have
to hold your hand and make you walk...

01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:45.330
Then I will teach you to even leave my hand
and stand strong against others!

01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:54.330
Like the time that stood still in front of death!

01:45:57.210 --> 01:45:59.040
Just kill him even if he takes a small step!

01:46:00.710 --> 01:46:03.660
Like the king who defeated death itself!

01:46:06.330 --> 01:46:07.660
Stamping the burning embers

01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:09.540
and walking on swords that slit!

01:46:10.330 --> 01:46:12.620
Killing the fear that raged in his heart!

01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:19.040
Like a brave heart who punishes,
he walked on!

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.210
Hunting the hunters...

01:46:30.750 --> 01:46:34.410
Came the warrior among hunters!

01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:39.120
To stop this sight of slavery...
Come... Oh! King!

01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:43.000
The hapless life's breath you guard...
Oh! King!

01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:46.370
Like an engulfed flame...
Spreading wild!

01:46:46.370 --> 01:46:47.540
You arrive!

01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:50.710
Hey...

01:46:50.710 --> 01:46:54.080
To authorize a new dawn rightfully...
Come... Oh! King!

01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:57.960
The hapless life's breath you guard...
Oh! King!

01:46:58.410 --> 01:47:01.330
To shake the skies and the earth....

01:47:01.330 --> 01:47:03.410
You arrive!

01:47:13.370 --> 01:47:15.160
Are you a gutsy warrior?

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:17.080
Are you a brave-heart?

01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:20.460
Or are you a demon?

01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:22.660
Are you a gutsy warrior?

01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:24.580
Are you a brave-heart?

01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:27.960
Or are you a demon?

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:31.660
What a class act!
I was sure that he will definitely come!

01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:41.830
In loneliness...
I am engulfed!

01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:45.660
In adulation I wait...

01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:49.160
Oh! my Emperor!
To me...

01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:51.160
Come to rule over me!

01:47:51.710 --> 01:47:56.250
Seeing you in your glory...

01:47:56.910 --> 01:48:00.370
I am drawn to you...

01:48:00.370 --> 01:48:04.000
Shall I pleasingly soothe you...

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.410
With my words?

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.500
The threat on our lives, you wipe it...
Come... Oh! King!

01:48:39.790 --> 01:48:43.160
The slaved minds to guard!
Oh! King!

01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:46.460
Shaking the very earth you walk on...

01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:48.540
You arrive!

01:48:50.710 --> 01:48:54.210
The perspiration of fear, you wipe it...
Come... Oh! King!

01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:57.870
The deafening thunder you caution and stand!
Oh! King!

01:48:58.710 --> 01:49:01.620
Like an engulfed flame...
Spreading wild!

01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:03.710
You arrive!

01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:07.460
Are you a gutsy warrior?

01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:09.370
Are you a brave-heart?

01:49:09.370 --> 01:49:12.750
Or are you a demon?

01:49:13.210 --> 01:49:15.000
Are you a gutsy warrior?

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.910
Are you a brave-heart?

01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:20.290
Or are you a demon?

01:49:20.710 --> 01:49:23.040
A respectful welcome!

01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:26.790
A respectful welcome!

01:49:28.210 --> 01:49:30.080
A respectful welcome!

01:49:35.130 --> 01:49:36.670
You are really gutsy sir,

01:49:36.790 --> 01:49:38.540
without even anybody telling you,
you have come forward!

01:49:38.670 --> 01:49:40.130
For this, why do you need guts man!

01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:42.170
your article itself will not get published...

01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:43.250
Why?

01:49:43.250 --> 01:49:44.290
Will he allow that!

01:49:46.630 --> 01:49:47.920
Without even being seen by anyone,

01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:49.630
sitting somewhere and making deals

01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:51.630
does that mean that he is such a coward?

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:54.000
Even if I get three kings,

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.090
the opponent must be having three aces
is how the world thinks,

01:49:57.380 --> 01:50:00.000
but he never bothered about the people in front of him!

01:50:00.210 --> 01:50:02.040
He was the winner with a blind man's bluff!

01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:05.000
I will tell you another incident, listen...

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.750
Once there was an attack in a pub,

01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:08.460
about twenty people with guns

01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:12.790
Started firing...

01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:14.380
The entire pub got destroyed!

01:50:17.790 --> 01:50:18.840
Hey... Supplier...

01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:20.420
What did you say it's name was?

01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:22.090
M16 Automatic, sir...

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.130
So many people...
Why did they attack him sir?

01:50:26.130 --> 01:50:26.710
Hey...

01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:27.670
That is wrong,

01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:28.710
don't write it like that!

01:50:33.590 --> 01:50:34.670
Sir... They will come sir!

01:50:35.090 --> 01:50:37.710
The twenty people hadn't come to attack him,

01:50:37.710 --> 01:50:40.540
he had come to attack those twenty people!

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.920
to make sure that no one escapes, he sat at the main door,

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:47.590
to check the guns the supplier brought,
directly he had come to the field,

01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:48.920
Alone...

01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:50.040
Hey...

01:50:50.250 --> 01:50:52.340
We are so many here, each of us have a gun,

01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:53.040
he has come alone,

01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:53.960
why are you afraid?

01:50:55.710 --> 01:50:56.960
Although so many of us are here,

01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:58.670
Even if we have a gun...

01:50:58.880 --> 01:50:59.960
he has come alone,

01:51:00.210 --> 01:51:01.380
won't I get scared?

01:51:03.710 --> 01:51:05.960
You must fear a little at least in life sir...

01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:07.130
Correct man...

01:51:07.630 --> 01:51:09.750
In life there should be fear,

01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:11.670
the fear should be there in the heart

01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:15.290
But the heart that fears should not be ours

01:51:15.290 --> 01:51:17.340
it must be that of our opponents!

01:51:19.290 --> 01:51:20.790
May I come in?

01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:23.290
Is he such a big gangster?

01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:26.340
The one who comes with a gang is a gangster!

01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:27.840
He comes alone...

01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:34.000
Monster!

01:51:38.670 --> 01:51:39.290
Anand...

01:51:44.170 --> 01:51:45.420
Again did I jump ahead...

01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:53.090
In KGF,

01:51:53.250 --> 01:51:55.880
about the internal scheming and brawls

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.670
Suryavardhan knew,

01:52:00.630 --> 01:52:02.130
In the coming days

01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:04.000
bigger battles will
come

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.750
to the doors of KGF
was also known by him!

01:52:16.590 --> 01:52:18.090
What Mr. Desai?

01:52:18.090 --> 01:52:19.750
You have come this far?
To Delhi...

01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:22.000
The sword which was getting ready in the furnace

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.290
has now come on my neck!

01:52:23.290 --> 01:52:24.250
That's why!

01:52:29.250 --> 01:52:30.590
Was it all for this...

01:52:30.590 --> 01:52:31.750
Uncle went,

01:52:32.630 --> 01:52:33.960
now even dad is going

01:52:34.290 --> 01:52:36.750
Till you see our blood spill, wont you stop??

01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:39.630
I don't know for how many days Boss will survive...

01:52:39.630 --> 01:52:42.340
After he leaves, have you thought
about what will happen to all of us??

01:52:42.540 --> 01:52:44.920
On my behalf, you all are busy thinking,

01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:47.040
With a fish in your hand

01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:48.960
you are trying to hunt a crocodile,

01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:52.630
but for the crocodile your hand looks tastier
than the fish.

01:52:53.130 --> 01:52:56.790
Just looking at hands full of blood
if you are getting so scared,

01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:59.380
before a river of blood flows

01:52:59.380 --> 01:53:01.040
you get out of here!

01:53:03.090 --> 01:53:06.210
The vultures are hovering around Narachi!

01:53:06.750 --> 01:53:09.590
Don't bother about the smaller waves...

01:53:09.590 --> 01:53:11.880
We have more headaches to worry about!

01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:13.880
After I depart,

01:53:14.210 --> 01:53:16.500
bigger Tsunamis will approach!

01:53:17.210 --> 01:53:19.000
Inayath Khaleel!

01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:23.880
He is waiting since many years!

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.920
Once if he enters...

01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:27.590
He will never leave!

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.540
This time's election,
do you know who is going to contest?

01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:35.710
Ramika Sen

01:53:35.710 --> 01:53:38.000
We all pay money to get a salute...

01:53:38.170 --> 01:53:39.540
On hearing her name itself

01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:41.710
people stand and salute her!

01:53:41.710 --> 01:53:43.840
If she comes to power...

01:53:46.630 --> 01:53:47.710
These two are enough...

01:53:48.170 --> 01:53:49.750
To spoil this kingdom!

01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:52.420
Think about them!

01:53:59.750 --> 01:54:01.000
How are you now?

01:54:02.210 --> 01:54:04.840
Is he the guy who killed the girl child?

01:54:32.670 --> 01:54:34.250
What happened to the matchbox I kept here?

01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:49.750
Felt like someone pushed me...

01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:53.460
Fire! Fire...

01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:56.210
Hey...
Stop man!

01:54:56.380 --> 01:54:57.500
There must be 105 people...

01:54:57.630 --> 01:54:58.590
First take their count!

01:55:00.670 --> 01:55:01.040
1,

01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:01.750
2,

01:55:02.170 --> 01:55:02.790
3,

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:03.460
4,

01:55:03.590 --> 01:55:03.960
5,

01:55:04.290 --> 01:55:04.670
6,

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:05.420
7,

01:55:05.790 --> 01:55:06.210
8,

01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:06.840
9,

01:55:07.170 --> 01:55:07.590
10,

01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:08.340
11,

01:55:08.670 --> 01:55:09.040
12,

01:55:09.340 --> 01:55:09.710
13,

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:10.500
14,

01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:11.250
19,

01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:12.040
16,

01:55:12.170 --> 01:55:12.750
17,

01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:13.500
18,

01:55:13.670 --> 01:55:14.040
15,

01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:14.750
20,

01:55:15.090 --> 01:55:15.460
21,

01:55:15.790 --> 01:55:16.170
22,

01:55:16.590 --> 01:55:17.210
23,

01:55:17.290 --> 01:55:17.880
24,

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:18.380
25,

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:19.540
26,

01:55:19.670 --> 01:55:20.210
27,

01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:20.960
28,

01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:21.420
29,

01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:22.040
30,

01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:22.880
31,

01:55:23.210 --> 01:55:23.590
32,

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:24.630
33,

01:55:24.710 --> 01:55:25.290
34,

01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:25.790
35,

01:55:26.090 --> 01:55:26.460
36,

01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:27.590
37,

01:56:05.670 --> 01:56:06.250
91,

01:56:06.250 --> 01:56:07.000
92,

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:07.710
93,

01:56:07.710 --> 01:56:08.420
94,

01:56:08.590 --> 01:56:09.250
95,

01:56:09.250 --> 01:56:09.960
96,
- Lorry,

01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:11.540
97, 98
- Lorry!

01:56:11.540 --> 01:56:12.380
99,

01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:13.090
100,

01:56:13.090 --> 01:56:13.790
101,

01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:14.590
102,

01:56:14.590 --> 01:56:15.250
103,

01:56:15.250 --> 01:56:15.960
104,

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:16.630
105,

01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:17.750
It is correct!

01:56:34.290 --> 01:56:35.460
Today's food...

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.670
You have prepared it very well!

01:56:52.170 --> 01:56:53.170
Take us too!

01:56:53.790 --> 01:56:54.590
Where?

01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:55.590
Outside...

01:56:56.500 --> 01:56:57.290
I know!

01:57:00.590 --> 01:57:02.170
If you open your mouth, I will kill you!

01:57:04.630 --> 01:57:05.630
I will fall at your feet!

01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:27.290
Someone's hand is behind the incident
that happened near the maintenance room!

01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:28.250
It felt like someone...

01:57:28.250 --> 01:57:29.750
Felt like someone hit me with a hammer!

01:57:30.210 --> 01:57:31.920
Even though there is so much security,

01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:33.040
someone has barged inside

01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:34.290
and has seen the map,

01:57:34.590 --> 01:57:36.420
the batch that came two day's earlier,

01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:39.540
one of them has come to kill you, I feel!

01:57:40.670 --> 01:57:42.130
To hit me??

01:57:42.130 --> 01:57:43.130
Here??

01:57:43.130 --> 01:57:46.500
Drinking the gruel you give over and again,

01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:48.000
he would have gone to eat a bun

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.290
in the maintenance room!

01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:51.250
We can't take the risk!

01:57:52.090 --> 01:57:53.210
Then...

01:57:53.210 --> 01:57:56.920
Call every single one who worked In that zone!

01:58:14.670 --> 01:58:15.750
Hello! Hello!

01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:17.920
Junior Boss is coming near the hutments..

01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:18.540
Over!

01:58:34.710 --> 01:58:37.040
Who was it who entered the maintenance room?

01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:39.210
If you come by yourself...

01:58:39.210 --> 01:58:40.840
Then only you will die...

01:58:41.130 --> 01:58:42.460
Otherwise...

01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:44.040
Everyone will die!

01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:46.340
Gun...

01:59:11.290 --> 01:59:13.250
If you know who he is, tell us...

01:59:13.420 --> 01:59:14.670
Your life will be spared!

01:59:58.130 --> 02:00:00.500
The one who doesn't even know how to hold a sword,

02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:02.460
will they call him to kill me?

02:00:06.630 --> 02:00:09.290
The one who crossed the maintenance room has been killed...

02:00:09.290 --> 02:00:11.460
Now the Junior Boss is going towards the Palace...
Over!

02:00:14.710 --> 02:00:16.090
Hello...
Your man has been caught,

02:00:16.090 --> 02:00:17.170
They shot him!

02:00:17.170 --> 02:00:17.540
What??

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:20.420
What happened?

02:00:20.670 --> 02:00:21.590
They killed Rocky, it seems!

02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:25.090
I told you that day itself,

02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:27.500
Calling that person from Bombay,
all of you...

02:00:27.500 --> 02:00:29.210
Now who you will call and what will you do,
is left to you!

02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:00.710
It's a baby girl!

02:01:43.630 --> 02:01:45.090
For the sake of this child,

02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:47.540
yesterday her father gave up his life!

02:01:48.250 --> 02:01:49.340
Take us too with you!

02:01:49.540 --> 02:01:52.170
Yesterday if he had not come forward,

02:01:52.170 --> 02:01:55.090
With me, they would have killed his pregnant wife!

02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:04.500
But, now they will target him!

02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:06.840
He... He...
He will protect us!

02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:12.340
For the palace of a million dreams,

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:18.960
I will stand guard, as a soldier...
Oh! Mother!

02:02:19.290 --> 02:02:24.250
To the plough that plows the land carefully,

02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:30.960
To provide a strong shoulder of support for it,
I will stand... Oh! Mother!

02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:34.290
When a burning flame flows...

02:02:34.290 --> 02:02:37.170
Burning the world,

02:02:37.590 --> 02:02:42.130
The soothing rain I will become,
Listen... Oh! Mother!

02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:44.590
At least once,

02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:48.040
I am hoping that the story he tells should become true!

02:03:19.090 --> 02:03:20.170
Mama...

02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:39.630
Mama...

02:04:09.380 --> 02:04:09.920
Hey...

02:04:11.210 --> 02:04:12.960
Let us finish the work and leave!

02:04:18.110 --> 02:04:19.820
Walk on...
Keep walking...

02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:21.400
Walk with your heads down!

02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:23.530
Go faster guys!

02:04:23.700 --> 02:04:25.530
Go faster! Go faster!

02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:40.570
Guys... Run... Run... Run!

02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:58.860
Boss!

02:04:58.860 --> 02:04:59.820
What happened boss...

02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:01.150
Remove your turban...

02:05:02.990 --> 02:05:03.610
Brother...

02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:08.610
Take off your turban, I say!!

02:05:13.490 --> 02:05:16.070
If you bring the turban and toss it in this basket

02:05:16.070 --> 02:05:17.150
I will let you go!

02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:30.360
Please don't...

02:06:12.110 --> 02:06:14.110
Go... Go! Go away....
What are you standing and looking at?

02:06:14.110 --> 02:06:15.200
Go... Go!

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:16.450
They knew he was blind,

02:06:16.450 --> 02:06:18.070
but your hero didn't do anything...

02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:19.570
Too much risk to take!

02:06:19.570 --> 02:06:20.360
Sir!!

02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:21.700
Why is he so quiet?

02:06:21.700 --> 02:06:22.820
Why is he so silent?
Tell me sir?

02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:23.990
Listen...
Now you are getting on my nerves!

02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:25.070
One minute Madam...
One minute...

02:06:25.070 --> 02:06:26.700
Sir, will he go back??

02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:29.610
Won't he do anything??

02:06:33.490 --> 02:06:34.820
We can't do anything...

02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:38.530
We can't rush and create history!

02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:40.200
Go guys!

02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:41.650
Go to hell!

02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:43.030
Leave it...

02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:44.400
What can be done??

02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:45.320
Hey... Leave...

02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:47.490
Today I will kill him...

02:06:47.490 --> 02:06:49.240
Be quite... Today I will kill him!

02:06:49.650 --> 02:06:50.700
He has become old...

02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:51.900
Wait man, wait!

02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:53.700
How long will he live?

02:06:53.700 --> 02:06:55.030
Let him die & live peacefully in heaven...

02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:55.900
Hey...

02:06:56.530 --> 02:06:58.780
Let him decide...
Leave him guy!

02:06:59.030 --> 02:07:01.860
Whose plate he stamps

02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:03.490
he must kill him!

02:07:03.490 --> 02:07:05.400
Write your names on the plate...

02:07:05.650 --> 02:07:06.820
Hey, write my name...

02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:09.200
What's the point in standing and watching?

02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:09.950
Let's move...

02:07:10.110 --> 02:07:11.450
You don't bother listening to them...

02:07:11.450 --> 02:07:12.110
Just leave!

02:07:12.110 --> 02:07:14.740
Till now no one has touched them!

02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:16.610
No one can even touch them...

02:07:18.030 --> 02:07:20.320
Go, go...
Alongwith the old man, dig a grave for the baby too!

02:07:22.530 --> 02:07:23.610
Don't cry baby...

02:07:23.950 --> 02:07:24.860
Don't cry...

02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:29.030
You can't rush and create history,

02:07:30.450 --> 02:07:31.990
that does not mean

02:07:31.990 --> 02:07:32.990
that you can plan history

02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:34.360
and create a blueprint for it!

02:07:44.490 --> 02:07:46.070
It just needs a spark!

02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:47.780
Why did you stand up?

02:07:48.110 --> 02:07:49.400
Keep that and leave...

02:07:49.860 --> 02:07:50.570
That day,

02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:53.900
The forest blazed furiously

02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:58.400
Hidden in the depths of his being,
The burning embers he unleashed, the lion-hearted brave-heart!

02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:05.740
Taunting every atom and every footprint,
Unleashing unbridled wrath, the magnificent warrior!

02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:09.070
No More 'Shut up Rocky!'

02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:15.450
Provoking the Warrior Dynasty, disturbing the very depths of the ocean...
Such a brave-heart, is this Emperor!

02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:23.200
Provoking the Warrior Dynasty, disturbing the very depths of the ocean...
Such a brave-heart, is this Emperor!

02:08:36.070 --> 02:08:37.700
Have you seen anyone jump so high?

02:09:12.610 --> 02:09:15.990
He came...

02:09:15.990 --> 02:09:17.650
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

02:09:17.650 --> 02:09:19.490
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

02:09:19.490 --> 02:09:21.610
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

02:09:21.610 --> 02:09:23.450
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

02:09:23.450 --> 02:09:25.570
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

02:09:25.570 --> 02:09:27.400
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:29.530
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

02:09:29.530 --> 02:09:31.070
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

02:09:38.570 --> 02:09:39.450
Walk on...

02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:41.700
No! He missed my plate!

02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:43.650
Mine too he missed!

02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:46.030
He missed it!

02:09:51.860 --> 02:09:55.700
Everytime he gets the chance!

02:09:56.570 --> 02:09:58.990
Hide & seek...

02:09:58.990 --> 02:10:00.950
Forest & nest,

02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:02.860
The bag of grains

02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:05.360
It rolled & fell,

02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:07.450
My bird flew away,

02:10:07.450 --> 02:10:09.570
I left it to fly!

02:10:09.570 --> 02:10:11.860
Your bird...

02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:13.360
Catch it guys!

02:10:15.610 --> 02:10:17.150
Hey... What happened to the electricity man?

02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:20.570
Go and see what happened guys...

02:10:24.860 --> 02:10:26.490
Who removed the fuse?

02:10:29.950 --> 02:10:32.570
It's Kencha... Run, run!

02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:38.860
Hey... Who hit him?

02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:42.110
Where is Naga?

02:10:45.610 --> 02:10:46.820
Who killed Muththa?

02:10:49.740 --> 02:10:50.950
They both are not to be seen guys!

02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:15.700
Kill him guys!

02:13:00.820 --> 02:13:01.400
Is he here?

02:13:02.570 --> 02:13:03.150
18,

02:13:03.150 --> 02:13:03.950
19,

02:13:03.950 --> 02:13:04.650
20,

02:13:04.650 --> 02:13:05.610
21,

02:13:05.610 --> 02:13:06.320
22,

02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:07.740
including you it's 23!

02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:09.990
Is the calculation correct man?

02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:40.780
Have you beaten everybody?

02:13:43.110 --> 02:13:44.780
I left one man...

02:13:46.610 --> 02:13:48.450
For the procession!

02:14:03.450 --> 02:14:07.110
The seeds planted in your heart,
you will ever remember!

02:14:07.110 --> 02:14:11.110
In muddy roads, thorny paths abound!

02:14:11.110 --> 02:14:13.990
Whatever be the obstacle...

02:14:13.990 --> 02:14:16.700
Cross it and come...

02:14:18.780 --> 02:14:20.860
Cross the darkest night...

02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:24.610
Bring the dawn with you...

02:14:32.070 --> 02:14:33.740
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

02:14:33.740 --> 02:14:35.780
He wields the sword of lightning!!

02:14:35.780 --> 02:14:37.900
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

02:14:37.900 --> 02:14:39.740
The saviour of the masses is a gutsy warrior!!

02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:41.860
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

02:14:41.860 --> 02:14:43.700
He wields the sword of lightning!!

02:14:43.700 --> 02:14:45.650
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

02:14:45.650 --> 02:14:47.320
The saviour of the masses is a gutsy warrior!!

02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:51.950
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

02:14:51.950 --> 02:14:53.990
He wields the sword of lightning!!

02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:56.110
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

02:14:56.110 --> 02:14:57.950
The saviour of the masses is a gutsy warrior!!

02:15:22.570 --> 02:15:25.700
They are hitting so hard today!

02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:28.610
Someone's luck must have run out!

02:16:28.820 --> 02:16:29.150
He...

02:16:29.150 --> 02:16:30.320
For the sake of the old man...

02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:31.490
For the sake of the baby...

02:16:31.490 --> 02:16:32.900
For their pain,

02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:34.650
or for his own self...

02:16:34.650 --> 02:16:36.110
Did he beat all of them...

02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:37.070
But,

02:16:37.450 --> 02:16:38.950
to all there,

02:16:39.150 --> 02:16:41.490
at least for sometime they felt relief...

02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:46.030
In all the cinemas,
there is one person right?

02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:48.360
If I keep seeing you, I feel the same way!

02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:49.030
Are you the hero?

02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.780
No...

02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:51.320
Villan!

02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:55.400
Don't worry!!

02:16:55.650 --> 02:16:56.740
We will bury him...

02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:58.150
Burn it...

02:16:58.450 --> 02:16:59.240
Why??

02:17:01.610 --> 02:17:02.950
I am ready now!

02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:08.990
Where is everyone?

02:17:09.070 --> 02:17:11.240
Inform the office that no one can be seen!

02:17:11.610 --> 02:17:13.530
By the time the village fair is over,

02:17:13.530 --> 02:17:16.030
we want to run away somewhere...

02:17:16.570 --> 02:17:19.160
You go to some other country...

02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:20.740
By believing just one man!

02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:22.200
we made a big mistake!

02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.860
Rocky...

02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:34.610
He is still alive...

02:17:38.570 --> 02:17:40.200
He has sent a signal...

02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:42.780
Once you are ready, send a big signal...

02:17:42.780 --> 02:17:43.950
In a big way!

02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:45.160
A big signal!

02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:58.160
Near the huts, a big fire is burning,

02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:00.160
The 23 guards in the Mine are missing...

02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:02.070
Everyone go near the huts, right away!

02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:05.530
The missing 23 guards must have be killed by Rocky

02:18:05.530 --> 02:18:08.280
and to make sure their bodies are not found,
he must have burned them!

02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:09.950
That means, we must do something...

02:18:09.950 --> 02:18:11.200
We must stop those jeeps...

02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:13.660
or else to get to know that Rocky is behind this,

02:18:13.660 --> 02:18:15.610
they will not hesitate to burn those 20,000 people!

02:18:15.610 --> 02:18:17.160
We must stop those jeeps!

02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:18.410
Something must be done!

02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:19.780
Something must be done!

02:18:22.610 --> 02:18:23.660
Father died...

02:18:50.530 --> 02:18:51.740
The guards are coming here...

02:18:51.740 --> 02:18:53.910
If they see us burning these 23 guards?

02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:54.820
What should we do then?

02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:56.160
Hey...

02:18:56.780 --> 02:18:59.360
The Big Boss has died!

02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:10.200
The Big Boss has died!

02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:37.200
Father...

02:19:37.700 --> 02:19:39.320
Boss...

02:19:41.450 --> 02:19:43.030
The boss has died!

02:19:45.860 --> 02:19:47.070
Lord Muruga...

02:19:51.240 --> 02:19:52.990
Something is not falling in the right place...

02:19:52.990 --> 02:19:54.660
You have a lot of enemies,

02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:55.910
leave the rest for now,

02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:58.280
it will be better if that fair does not take place next week!

02:19:58.450 --> 02:19:59.740
Priest...

02:19:59.740 --> 02:20:00.360
Boss...

02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:02.780
Tonight itself arrange for the Goddesses blessings,

02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:05.360
by dawn tomorrow

02:20:06.570 --> 02:20:08.820
I should not have any enemies!

02:20:09.990 --> 02:20:13.490
On one side, Vaanaram has suspected something
and has tightened the security...

02:20:19.320 --> 02:20:22.200
On the other side, Garuda's brother Virat is waiting...

02:20:22.660 --> 02:20:24.360
No one should be allowed near the Junior Boss's room!

02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:27.910
By dawn, crossing so much security,

02:20:27.910 --> 02:20:29.450
even if he manages to kill Garuda...

02:20:29.450 --> 02:20:30.990
How willl he escape from there?

02:20:32.320 --> 02:20:33.950
I am setting the frequency of the Walky,

02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:35.910
We have to inform something...

02:20:36.530 --> 02:20:37.410
Something!

02:20:37.820 --> 02:20:38.610
Let's go...

02:20:40.490 --> 02:20:41.950
If he does not kill him, what will his fate be,

02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:44.160
what will the fate of the people be?

02:20:46.660 --> 02:20:47.860
You had called for me urgently,

02:20:48.160 --> 02:20:48.740
What's that??

02:20:48.990 --> 02:20:50.280
Which you can't say over the phone?

02:20:50.410 --> 02:20:51.030
Father...

02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:52.780
Will you tell him?

02:20:54.860 --> 02:20:55.820
Or should I tell him??

02:20:58.240 --> 02:21:00.360
Whatever be the place,

02:21:00.610 --> 02:21:02.490
whoever be the people there...

02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:05.530
The guy who went, he is my lover...

02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:08.610
Will you say

02:21:10.160 --> 02:21:11.490
or should I say it!

02:21:15.070 --> 02:21:16.410
I am getting scared!

02:21:16.820 --> 02:21:19.660
Other than getting scared, what have we done?

02:21:21.570 --> 02:21:23.570
From the time these walls have been built,

02:21:23.570 --> 02:21:24.740
I am right here!

02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:26.780
We are living like slaves!

02:21:26.780 --> 02:21:28.950
We will die like slaves, is what I thought!

02:21:30.280 --> 02:21:32.660
But now I have got courage,

02:21:33.450 --> 02:21:34.780
I have got belief!

02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:37.530
Hey.. Hang it on the nail...
- Make way...

02:21:37.530 --> 02:21:38.950
Hang it...
- Fine... Come... Come... Come!

02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:44.200
Who is he,

02:21:44.450 --> 02:21:47.160
why has he come here, I was wondering!

02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:52.160
Now I understood...

02:21:52.860 --> 02:21:56.320
He has come to change fiction into fact!

02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:17.860
There has been a short circuit!

02:22:17.860 --> 02:22:19.200
In the whole town of Narachi, the power has been cut!

02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:23.200
Near Biligere too, the guards are stationed!

02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:25.240
Run towards the Boss's room!

02:22:31.610 --> 02:22:33.740
In front of Junior Boss's room,
the guards are stationed!

02:22:34.860 --> 02:22:37.030
We are escorting him from here to the Goddesses Fair!

02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:37.490
Over!

02:22:39.570 --> 02:22:40.360
Where has he gone?

02:22:40.740 --> 02:22:41.410
Has he run away?

02:22:41.860 --> 02:22:42.360
Has he run away?

02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:44.990
There, in the village fair, the walky signal will get cut!

02:22:44.990 --> 02:22:45.990
Lots of people there,

02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:46.860
be alert...

02:22:46.860 --> 02:22:49.110
No one should even go near the Junior Boss...

02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:49.950
Leave...

02:22:50.570 --> 02:22:51.110
Tell me sir...

02:22:51.490 --> 02:22:52.860
If Rocky does not kill Garuda...

02:22:53.530 --> 02:22:55.070
What will the fate of the people be?

02:22:56.860 --> 02:22:57.740
She is there, right?

02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:59.700
Our mother...

02:23:01.990 --> 02:23:02.910
Goddess Mariamma!

02:23:13.110 --> 02:23:14.450
In the Goddesses fair!

02:23:14.450 --> 02:23:15.490
In the fair...

02:23:15.490 --> 02:23:17.410
In the fair he will kill him!

02:23:27.860 --> 02:23:29.200
The short circuit is near Billigere...

02:23:35.570 --> 02:23:37.160
Because someone rolled the copper wire to a stone

02:23:37.160 --> 02:23:38.860
and threw it on the electrical cable,

02:23:38.860 --> 02:23:41.450
the short circuit has cut the power in the whole town of Narachi!

02:23:47.780 --> 02:23:50.820
Within 10 seconds of the power getting shut,
the jeep lights & torch lights were on!

02:23:50.820 --> 02:23:51.860
In that 10 seconds time,

02:23:51.860 --> 02:23:54.990
it is impossible for anyone to pass unnoticed by us sir...

02:23:57.280 --> 02:23:58.910
Where does this tunnel go?

02:24:00.450 --> 02:24:02.280
In the whole of Naraachi, only this tunnel...

02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:04.070
Goes directly to the Boss's house!

02:24:50.740 --> 02:24:52.410
Even if someone has short circuited it,

02:24:52.410 --> 02:24:54.950
to cross Biligire and then come here through the tunnel,

02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:56.110
they need a lot of time...

02:24:56.110 --> 02:24:57.530
By then, because you alerted them,

02:24:57.530 --> 02:24:59.820
all the guards in the palace,

02:24:59.820 --> 02:25:00.740
came to the Junior Boss's room

02:25:00.740 --> 02:25:01.570
and escorted him to the fair!

02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:03.780
Where else could he have gone...

02:25:11.070 --> 02:25:12.160
Trumpets!

02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:36.910
When the electricity was shut,

02:25:36.910 --> 02:25:39.360
the guards who were here
too had come to the Junior Boss's room...

02:25:40.530 --> 02:25:41.820
You don't worry sir,

02:25:41.990 --> 02:25:44.110
by the time boss finishes the fair and returns,

02:25:44.110 --> 02:25:45.950
the whole palace will be secured...

02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:53.610
Bring the 3 prisioners in front guys...

02:25:58.110 --> 02:25:59.110
Panju...

02:26:16.570 --> 02:26:18.410
He short circuited and cut the electricity

02:26:18.410 --> 02:26:20.530
not to enter the palace but to come here!

02:26:20.780 --> 02:26:22.360
Ramana, he is still there...

02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:24.070
Ramana, I am unable to catch the signal!

02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:25.240
Everyone go to the fair

02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:27.240
and also inform the Barracks and ask everybody to come...

02:26:37.530 --> 02:26:38.450
Ramana...

02:26:38.570 --> 02:26:39.320
Ramana...

02:26:39.780 --> 02:26:41.660
He is still there!

02:26:58.820 --> 02:27:00.360
He is still there Ramana...

02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:01.490
Ramana...

02:27:18.780 --> 02:27:20.740
The cell where the 3 prisioners were,

02:27:21.110 --> 02:27:21.910
One...

02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:23.240
One prisioner is still there...

02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:46.070
Hey...

02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:05.280
Shantamma!

02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:06.450
Hey! Stand right there!
- Mamma... Leave me!

02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:08.030
Your son is going out of control!

02:28:08.030 --> 02:28:09.610
He has formed a gang and has gone to hit them up!

02:28:09.610 --> 02:28:10.570
Not only did he go,

02:28:10.570 --> 02:28:11.950
but he took our children too!

02:28:11.950 --> 02:28:13.110
High time you you advised your son!

02:28:13.110 --> 02:28:15.070
He tortured me in school daily mama!

02:28:15.070 --> 02:28:16.780
That's why mama,
I went to hit him!

02:28:18.860 --> 02:28:21.030
Hey... You took a gang and went!

02:28:23.610 --> 02:28:24.490
Go alone!

02:28:24.490 --> 02:28:25.360
Aiyo! Lord Shiva!

02:28:33.780 --> 02:28:35.320
Hello...

02:28:35.410 --> 02:28:36.240
Sir...

02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:37.070
Tell Kulkarni...

02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:38.160
He killed him sir...

02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:39.200
What did you say,

02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:40.160
Tell me again...

02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:42.990
He has killed Garuda sir...

02:28:49.450 --> 02:28:52.200
Everyone came know about Garuda's death!

02:28:56.240 --> 02:28:59.360
Like Suryavardhan said...
The trumpets were waiting!

02:29:01.410 --> 02:29:03.070
There is news from India...

02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:06.360
The were waiting to destroy KGF...

02:29:06.530 --> 02:29:08.570
Madam in KGF...

02:29:10.990 --> 02:29:11.700
Brother,

02:29:11.700 --> 02:29:12.660
Garuda died...

02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:15.860
They were also waiting to reclaim it!

02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:17.030
Adeera!

02:29:17.070 --> 02:29:17.780
Brother...

02:29:17.860 --> 02:29:21.160
Till Garuda was alive, I will not wish to desire this place...

02:29:23.110 --> 02:29:28.110
My brother said that I did not know politics...

02:29:31.610 --> 02:29:34.360
But the fact that another person's
footsteps had fallen there...

02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:37.700
This nobody knew!

02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:46.530
Powerful people come from powerful places...

02:29:47.700 --> 02:29:51.660
When Andrews said he will give Bombay like giving a candy,

02:29:51.780 --> 02:29:54.740
for Rocky the ocean also became just a well...

02:29:59.490 --> 02:30:01.860
Thinking the ocean was elsewere, he went searching for it...

02:30:01.860 --> 02:30:04.160
when he saw Garuda, It was confirmed to Rocky that

02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:07.450
here is man who comes from that powerful place.

02:30:07.950 --> 02:30:09.280
So, even though he got a chance,

02:30:09.280 --> 02:30:10.700
he did not finish him.

02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:12.070
He left him...

02:30:14.860 --> 02:30:17.740
To obtain KGF, he needed an army,

02:30:20.030 --> 02:30:21.240
That's why Rocky,

02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:23.240
in front of everyone he killed Garuda

02:30:23.660 --> 02:30:25.700
And injected courage to all those who witnessed it

02:30:25.860 --> 02:30:27.860
and made them all his soldiers!

02:30:31.490 --> 02:30:32.240
Hey...

02:30:32.610 --> 02:30:34.110
What are you looking at?
Kill him!

02:30:34.110 --> 02:30:38.490
If 400 people with guns were ready to kill as ordered by Vanaram,

02:30:38.860 --> 02:30:41.700
20,000 people had mustered coyrage in their hearts

02:30:41.700 --> 02:30:44.110
and were ready to die for Rocky!

02:30:47.240 --> 02:30:50.990
If you draw courage from the thousand people standing behind you...

02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:54.530
Then you can win only one battle!

02:30:56.240 --> 02:30:58.360
But if the fact that you are leading them...

02:30:58.360 --> 02:31:00.570
Makes those 1000 people behind you brave,

02:31:02.860 --> 02:31:04.490
you can win the whole world!

02:31:07.950 --> 02:31:09.240
Go...

02:31:10.910 --> 02:31:11.820
Go alone!

02:31:12.030 --> 02:31:16.820
He came...

02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:21.700
This is still the first chapter...

02:31:23.020 --> 02:31:23.990
The story...

02:31:24.160 --> 02:31:25.610
I am enforcing the Army

02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:27.140
And signing a Death Warrant

02:31:27.140 --> 02:31:29.070
of the biggest criminal in India.

02:31:31.020 --> 02:31:33.250
Now it is just the beginning...
